        "The code below was primarily written by Professor Hall, but modified and added to by me. It now creates CSVs instead of plain text files, this is helpful for some text analysis codes, and is nice organizationally if you're trying to manually inspect the results. I also got rid of much of the filler, such as who commented or posted something, and any associated words like reply or comment. This is basically front loading the removal of reddit specific stopwords in case you're using a boiler plate text analysis code or a program that doesn't let you directly edit the code. It's still possible to visually tell what is a post vs. comment vs. reply since the space and indentation formattting is maintained, but will be ignored by most text analysis."

Reddit recently, October 2025, made it harder to get an API key which is required for this method (shout out AI developers, this is why we can't have nice things). Users are now required to submit a formal request through an online form, but it seems like turnaround time and approval are both iffy, so best of luck 🤷. If you want to give requesting a key an attempt heres the post regarding these changes, with the necessary forms linked: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/1oug31u/introducing_the_responsible_builder_policy_new"

My Pinterests are\\ngardening, recipes, decorating and oil painting. 80% of the searches now are ai\\nor clickbait. It feels like such a loss. Pinterest used to be my happy place.\\nNow I just feel exploited. \\n \\n\\n\\n It\\u2019s such a shame, I have the same experience. Pinterest used to mostly (for me)\\nlink to blog posts showing their interiors or crafts or cooking. I didn\\u2019t mind\\nthat at all. But blogging died and 90% of my results now are AI which link to\\ntemu. Pointless. \\n \\n\\n\\n It feels good to vent.   This subreddit is like a wake for a dear departed app.\\nUninstall. Time to let go.   Maybe they will see the numbers and fix things. \\n \\n\\n\\n I completely agree. I stopped \\u201cpinning\\u201d and switched switched to looking for\\nsomething online and taking screenshots. Then I have an app that auto-syncs them\\nfrom my gallery and categorizes and titles them. It also shows some suggestions\\n- sometimes they are useful. \\n \\n\\n\\n Pinterest is dead---unless you're trying to sell something or advertise. I quit\\nit long ago! Too frustrating... \\n \\n\\n\\n Same! I deleted my Pinterest last week. Not of value anymore. \\n \\n\\n\\n I just backed up all my pins, deleted almost everything, made my account\\nprivate, kicked off all my followers (except for people I know IRL) yesterday.\\nI'm done. Maybe I will eventually permanently delete my account. \\n \\n     How do you back up your pins\\n\\n\",\n          \"Come for the Inspiration, Stay for the Bugs and Ads\\n\\nBeen on Pinterest for years, and it\\u2019s gone from a creativity hub to a glitchy ad\\nmachine. If you\\u2019ve been around long enough, you might relate to this mess:  1.\\nAccount once suspended for no clear reason (got it back after chasing support).\\n2. Ads everywhere \\u2014 like, \\u201cscroll, shop, repeat.\\u201d   3. Comment box sometimes\\njust\\u2026 gives up.   4. Can\\u2019t even highlight comments on my own pins.   5. Saved\\npins randomly vanish.   6. Pins show \\u201cRemoved by creator\\u201d when I didn\\u2019t touch\\nthem.   7. Content taken down despite following guidelines.   8. App glitches \\u2014\\ncan\\u2019t move certain pins to sub-boards.   9. Engagement stats stuck at zero or\\nnot loading.   10. Videos playing with audio only (free black screen upgrade).\\n11. More ideas section showing completely unrelated pins \\u2014 or disappearing from\\nolder boards entirely.   12. Harmless content flagged for no reason.   13.\\nSearch bar randomly stops working.    Honestly, can\\u2019t wait to see what exciting\\nnew bugs and ads they roll out next \\ud83d\\ude02\\n\\n If your account has been deactivated, and you're looking to appeal the decision,\\nplease check all inboxes to see if you received an email from Pinterest.

I still use Pinterest a lot for mood boards and\\norganizing ideas, but outside of it things get a little messy.   Do you have a\\nsystem for saving ideas that don\\u2019t come from Pinterest? Like how do you keep\\ntrack of those things you want to remember or try later?  Thanks!\\n\\n I just save it to my external. hard drive and organize it into folders, then\\nedit the folder image to match the theme. \\n \\n     What a system! Do you ever review the things you save? Go through them and delete them when needed?\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
