 Well start using private mode on safari.

     That’s 30 minutes more than I need.

     That was 6 visits...

     Out of the 6:40 on Reddit probably 6 hrs watching redgifs lol. Now add that to the 31 min

     You gotta pump those numbers up

     Probably in the last week too his top is YouTube with 22 hrs

     Lol 😂😂😂



 Use another browser for those. I really like Aloha since it also let's me
download a video and save it within the browser very easily if I really like it.
Also has a passcode/face/touch-id option. 
 
     Same here I got all of my porn sites on there lol

     I use aloha as well

     Brave is also good, also has PiP for YouTube and background playback for YouTube Music

     So it supports all websites to download ?

     Aloha crew representin!

 Well to get it off that screen, you need to watch 7 minutes of Netflix, use
YouTube Studio for 14 minutes, and play Subway Surfer for somewhere between 15
and 30 minutes. 
 


 Use twitter instead.

 The OF accounts you are visiting have link tree and Insta links in them. They
probably pull in data from both and so you “viewing” them while you are perusing
the OF content. 
 
     Obviously it’s the other way around!  All the content on Insta, YouTube and so on is linked to some evil
    OF accounts. That’s why he has 11+ hours of OF

"Sometimes I wake up much later than my alarm time but see my phone on this screen with no sound, does that mean I slept through my alarm or that there wasn’t any sound?","Sometimes I wake up much later than my alarm time but see my phone on this screen with no sound, does that mean I slept through my alarm or that there wasn’t any sound?

It’s very confusing because my alarm does wake me up, but sometimes I oversleep
and this is the screen i see.   I’m confused whether it glitched out and didn’t
make a sound or that I was in a very deep sleep that I never heard the sound and
it stopped ringing lol.

 Happened to me too. Idk if I just slept hard or if it was no sound? 
 
     I’m confused 😭



 Yes, this means you overslept!   This is a long-time ""bug"" that I'm convince
isn't even a bug. Timers and alarms that go unanswered for an extended period of
time will stop ringing, but the screens will stay. I'm assuming it's actually
probably a feature specifically for the purposes of your post; to let you know
that it *did*, in fact, go off, and you just missed it. 
 
     But i have Apple Watch that literally vibrates with the alarm. It’s insane that i slept through both of
    those 😭

     Hard agree - I can’t recall the amount of time, maybe 15 minutes? It’s happened to me many times. I’m an
    under slept, hard sleeper.   I’ve personally observed it when my partner oversleeps and they refuse to
    believe it, LOL. Something I’ve also noticed is that if your phone is turned towards you and it catches
    you looking at it (as if you’re viewing it), it lowers the volume due to “awareness” or something…  Not a
    bug IMO - get an analog alarm clock and you won’t have any of those issues

     It's working exactly as you described it. I wish the phone tried harder.

7c7dab95062e5620ff185a710030b72f8d34c3  Make sure you have “Change with Button”
in the Ringtone and Alerts section turn off. This will ensure everytime you
change volume - it will not affect alerts. And make sure the sound is on. 
 
     i’ve always had this turned off and I’ve used iphone since iphone4 days. This “silent” alarm still
    happened to me several times, this button isn’t the root cause for it. I’ve even caught the “silent” alarm
    go off in front of my eyes when the alarm wasn’t set to silent nor was the phone facing me (face ID eye
    detection automatically lowers alarm volume, though not completely silencing it).

     Best way to do alarm is through Sleep. Otherwise I swear the volume changes even with this. With sleep it
    is always the exact same level.

     Nahhh I change both my media and ringer volume every night, charge my phone across my room, DND turned off
    at least 5 mins before my alarm if it’s on at all, multiple alarm times, and even with all of this, it’s
    probably 50/50 on a basic alarm actually working.



 [deleted] 
 
     This was my issue. If the phone is aimed at my face, it would do this. I can't remember if it made the
    alarm silent or super quiet, but I would regularly miss it.   Turning off the aware setting has fixed it.
    It's been a couple months with no problems.

     That happens to me constantly if I forget to lay my phone facedown. It's so frustrating. Also, it's
    awkward to always get the magnets lined up then turn my phone over without breaking the connection.



 Could be either one. There is a bug that affects a very small number of people
where the alarm doesn’t ring at all. For everyone else where it works properly,
the alarm eventually stops making noise but this screen remains active. It’s
more likely that you slept through your alarm. People have been doing that for
the entire history of alarm clocks. 
 


 Ugh, yes and it’s infuriating. Seems to be a long known bug. It’s just stuck in
the “ringing” screen without making a sound. 
 
     Me too



 This has happened to me a few times. I've seen other people discuss it so it
must be a known iOS bug - the alarm will not sound every now and then. It's
annoying. I don't know the fix... 
 
     Me too



 Happens to me so often that I have to keep another android phone just for the
alarm. Its ridiculous that a trillion dollar company cannot solve this problem. 
 
     Why would you get an entire phone instead of just getting an actual alarm clock



 WHY OH WHY.. Can't we just have three sliders in settings.  Siri Volume  Media
Volume  Alarm Volume     Then Siri could be used to set/check each when needed,
the volume buttons could be set to which one you wanted, but at least if you set
to media, then you would still hear your alarms in the morning.   Apple have
never had a satisfactory response to this issue and it's existed since the
earliest days of iOS. 
 


 I think it happens when alarm has been ringing without attention for long time

 Looks amazing! How did you get it to register such a large part of the photo in
front of the time? On iPhone if you go above 1 pixel it doesn’t bother with the
effect 
 
     [deleted]

     I can get it to almost 50% of the clock. On iOS 17.1 fwiw

     It’s doing it on its own.



 The shuffle photo effect doesn’t even work for me. It chooses 4-5 photos from a
vacation last year, and maybe like 3 nature photos, and refuses to shuffle
through any of the other like 10gb of photos I have on my phone that are in the
enabled categories 
 
     Yeah exact same thing, it's like it picks its favorites and sticks with those, very strange.

     At the bottom is an option to choose photos manually from your Library.  You can choose up to 50 that way.



 Cool 
 


 That's cool. 
 


 If this was on android, iOS people would immediately go crazy about it not being
readable at all. which it kinda isn't. 
 
     If you can’t read that then there’s a job for you in IT Management!

     I can read it but it's very inconvenient



 Could you please share the wallpaper please? Thanks 
 
     It’s just a photo I took. iOS is choosing it as a Lock Screen photo, then cycling through a few others
    photos.



 Is that a portrait image?

 It looks interesting! You can turn it of thought! 
 


 Looked bad ngl 
 
     I didn’t do it, iOS did that.

     It’s putting the time behind whatever’s in the photo.  Have it now somewhat behind a dogs head.

Why doesn’t time show on this screen?!,"Why doesn’t time show on this screen?!

It’s very annoying that I can’t add the clock to this screen, and that pulling
this screen down removes the time from the top-left of the phone where it
normally is.

 I think a little quality-of-life change would be that when you are customizing
which controls you want and where, that you should be able to freeze some in
place. I hate it when I want to move one to a specific location and the rest of
the layout moves around like that old arcade game, Snake. 
 
     Same for the home screen. I was trying to re-organize my apps, and every time I would move one app, it
    would literally change the organization of all of the rest of the apps. I was getting annoyed.

     yes i totally agree. and the ability to add a widget to the new control centre would be nice



 Wait until you have to tap twice to turn off cellular data on iOS 18. 
 
     Isn’t the whole point of iOS 18’s control centre that it’s customisable?

     But you can just not lift the finger while scrolling the control center, you can get directly into the
    connectivity panel and just one press to turn it off.  I actually like the change.

     When you swipe down from the corner to open the Control Menu, you can just keep pulling down a little bit
    further and then it will automatically open the connections page.   Then you can tap the cellular icon or
    whatever icon you want. One swipe, one tap. All of them are on that page.

     Cellular data has its own toggle that you can add separately. But no wifi

     You can add the cellular data toggle directly to the control page. It doesn't have to only be the radios
    page or via the combined control.

     The implementation is very anti apple too.  I can't hold my finger down to seek, and release to toggle.
    Trying to do this gives you a very unsatisfactory immediate vanish.  The top screen area becoming buttons
    that I will rarely use (+ add widgets, and power off) are absurd. A tiny, unreachable, unreliable area to
    add interactivity. Much rather have a time/clock/battery/nothing at all.  This whole update feels
    unstable, inconvenient to use, and anti-apple.  They went all in on the widget-like half-baked
    implementations.

     Long swipe down is the wireless menu. Short swipe down is the standard menu assuming you haven’t edited
    the pages yet.

     You can add cellular data to the control center to turn it off with one tap in iOS 18

     Is this something to complain about? SO many times, I’ve accidentally turned off cellular data by trying
    to press the Bluetooth thing. It’s very annoying when you have to wait for the phone to reconnect to
    continue what you’re doing, and it’s even worse when you were in an app or game that requires internet and
    you get booted out because of an accidental misclick

     I don't care about turning off cellular data. In fact, I use it instead of my home internet because it's
    faster.

     Why would you ever want or need to turn off cellular data?

     No, you don’t have to…

     Ffs

     🤨

     Then make a shortcut toggle. Simple as that.

     You can add a control if it bothers you so much?

     Or add the shortcut and only tap once

     [removed]



 uhhhhhh because uhhhhhhhhhh 
 


 ...or the date for cryin' out loud. 
 
     I mean just swipe down on the left side of the screen instead of right.

     It’s bizarre!

     It becomes a nightmare when your phone is charging, then you have to tap it for the date to show



 You will love the groundbreaking revolutionary new triple-tap feature to view
media in the photos app! Outstanding new feature.

 Les cleaning hint is interesting 
 
     I've had friends/family say they need a new phone because ""the camera sucks now"", every time I check their
    lens it has a nice thick layer of oil and grime on it. After clearing good as new.

     Am I the only one who always quickly wipes the lense before taking photos?

     Sorry to be the ""Androids have had this for years"" guy, but it's true. My Pixel is extremely good at
    telling me. And the #1 reason iPhone photos look so bad is because their owners don't know when to clean
    their camera lens.

     Why are people so disgusting? Just clean your stuff & maintain order...

     Thank god, at least Samsung phones have had this foreverrrr and I hate seeing people take photos with
    dirty lenses

     Big one for my mother

     Still baffling that it wasn't already a thing

     Wow Apple finally reinvented the alarm 🤣🤣

     We should let our workplace set this setting for us.

     Im glad they finally got around to it.  People stopped complaining about not having this about 10-15 years
    ago 

     and who told them 9 minutes was the right amount to begin with?

     And proves Cook a liar after he claimed this couldn’t be done.

     I too have slightly adjusted the margins and font size to hit a paper length.

     I have one for them: a working keyboard

     It seems so, and the usual iOS presentation page on their website doesn't have an ""all features"" detailed
    page this year. It seems like this is almost only a design and stability update.

     Wasn’t accessibility reader already a thing?

     maybe but you have to remember they always omit all the new features specifically tied to the upcoming
    iPhone refresh.

 Export notes to markdown is MASSIVE. I paid for a third party app to do this as

     That really is MASSIVE. Not an Apple move at all also, they usually want you to be as locked in the
    ecosystem as you can lmao

     Massive from a useful to you perspective. Trivial from an implementation perspective...  Its like time to
    charge - not some revolutionary feature. Just bothering to do something useful to your users you've not
    bothered doing for years...

     They don’t offer BULK import/export. It is useless.

     Probably added for genai stuff

      Excuse my ignorance, but how is that useful?



 Finally estimated time to charge, most probably for Apple Intelligence
compatible models only  Edit: Apparently not restricted to Apple Intelligence
capability. Good on Apple 
 
     yeah seems not to be available on my 14 pro  CORRECTION: It does show a display on the lock screen where
    the date is now saying “76% charged. 5m to 80%”, but i don’t have any setting for it.

     Because it doesn’t require AI but they still brand it as “battery intelligence”.  I call it catching up to
    Android still.

     Only took how many years? This company is so a$$

     Even if it was, let's be honest, in 5 years most iPhones out will be compatible - it's obvious they have
    to gatekeep some features with how hard it is now to innovate in the phone market. I'm not that angry at
    that either when you consider we complained about EXACTLY this couple years back on the iPhone 6s and 7
    release, ""new features drain too much battery on older models"" well no shit, it's just how it works!
    Still, works on all ""recent"" models, no need for AI.

     remaining capacity / charge rate. took years.

     ohhh ok well good



 The two airpod features and the password history are solid additions.  It a

How was my kid able to disable screen time limits with out the PIN?,"How was my kid able to disable screen time limits with out the PIN?

I turned on screen time limits for my son so he would get sleep on school nights
and it seemed to be working for a while. I just went to make some adjustments
and discovered “Screen Time for iPhone has not been available for 7 days. Make
sure the device is connected to the internet and is signed into iCloud with
Child’s Apple Account.”  The device is connected to the internet and he is
signed in, because I can see him in Find My. He definitely didn’t have the PIN.
Any ideas how he got around the parental controls? iOS 18.4.x

 Ha. The power of youth!   VPN or custom DNS? That’s a potential culprit if he’s
loaded a custom dns or is using a vpn of some sort. This will block Apple for
time syncing but will allow findmy to still be used.  Time zone - are you
automatically or manually setting time in date & time? If it’s not automatic, he
could be changing that.  Random apps - any random apps installed that look sus?
A calculator app perhaps or something weird or kinda random? It may have a
workaround in it to do other stuff.

 hey, i’m a teen who got around the screen time my dad set on my phone in 2
different ways 2 different times  1. I reset my phone with Apple devices. very
simple process, all you need is a cable, the unlocked phone and the apple
devices app on a computer, the screen time pin is not required to reset the
phone, simply create a new icloud account  2. my dad took my phone and put
screen time back on it and he tried to remove my old account (no longer linked
to any device) but accidentally turned off screen time on my current account.
before he noticed his mistake i created my own pin  —————————————————-  this is

     HUGE bro code violation. :(

     Why you snitching?!

     Happy cake day I guess



 My partner’s child kept getting round screen time, and I put it down to screen
time being naff. We eventually figured out that she knew the code (that we kept
changing). The code was on a shared note and was on our devices. She knew her
mum’s PIN for her iPad and was going through her stuff.  
 
     wdym round and naff?



 The only way I found is to erase the iPad and restore it from a backup, which
solved the issue for me.  Tried with Apple support, and pretty much they are
useless. 
 


 ive heard of people turning on screen record just before its unlocked so that
they can see the pin that their parents put in 
 
     That’s pretty clever! Couldn’t be the cause in this case though because I manage it from my device.



 Best to monitor rather than limit. 
 
     Not always possible with my work schedule. Setting a cutoff on school nights prevents any shenanigans. No
    temptations to try to sneak access, no need for me to check throughout the night. Not sure what the
    problem is.

     This is not true. You need to limit AND monitor. Teens do not need open access to social media platforms
    or their phone in general. They need limits! App time limits. Phone limits. Contact limits. The works.
    Parents who are not limiting AND monitoring their teens and preteens phones are doing them a disservice.
    Just look at the link between phones and teen suicide. It’s out of control.



 Back when I was a teen and it was called restrictions, I got past it with a
YouTube tutorial that showed me how to access the raw files of my phone by
plugging it into my computer, find an encrypted version of the password, then
run it through a website that tried every possible combination until it matched.
Probably not helpful for your case, but my point is if your son’s tech savvy,
he’ll always find a way.

I can use 12 hours of Instagram. So I don’t need anybody in the comments saying
“just listen to your parents” I’m about to graduate high school and I manage to
regulate my social media usage normally. I use Instagram to interact with a lot
of my friends and not just for reels, and I use YouTube for much more than just
mindless videos. I use YouTube for tutorials, schoolwork, etc etc. They do not
care about any of that and have instituted one hour for Instagram (combined with
Pinterest because I can use Pinterest as a bypass) as well as one hour for
YouTube. Anyways, is there any way I can bypass this? I also have a MacBook with
shared restrictions btw if that helps.

 Ask mommy or daddy again to turn off screen time. 
 
     Did you even read the post 



 There’s nothing you can do, they have your best interests at heart. You’ll thank
them later, as will mine. 
 
     I don’t think they do lmao, as you’d know if you met them 



 if you're about to graduate high school... why are you on restriction? if you're
16/17 close to 18... you won't be able to bypass restrictions on the apps. and
the browser goes straight back to the app. get a part time after school job and
buy a used phone to use with wifi only without restrictions. 
 
     All of my money goes through them :/



 This isn't a full bypass but you can visit websites kinda: go to settings and
get where you can add a mail account. Tap choose from list then choose Google.
It'll bring you to the accounts.google.com thing now go to the bottom hit
privacy and it'll bring you to the privacy page. Tap the 9 dots then search for
whatever website you want to use. Sadly no desktop page viewing or landscape bit
better than nothing. I'm currently posting this comment through this method so
if you see this it works 
 
     Theres no ""add mail account button"" in settings 



 Interesting that he asked a good question and 90% of the replies are either
“Grow Up”, “You’ll thank them later” and the type of shit only parents would
say. Anywho, just what iOS do you have? I might know some tricks 
 
     They lowkey removed it bc I asked when I was at a sleepover and I’m just not gonna mention it again lol 



 either pled your case with your parents or get a part-time job and get your own
phone. I mean you are old enough I agree you should sink or swim with your own
online self-regulating, but it's your parent's phone so they call the shots
here. 
 
     They control my finances so even if I wanted to I couldn’t. And they’d just restrict the phone too and
    punish me if I didn’t let them.



 For the MacBook you should be able to make another user account that is local
and not associated with an apple id

Malware With Screen Reading Code Found in iOS Apps for the First Time,"Malware With Screen Reading Code Found in iOS Apps for the First Time

Summary Through Apple Intelligence: Malware called “SparkCat,” capable of
reading sensitive information from screenshots, has been discovered in iOS apps.
The malware, active since March 2024, targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but
could potentially access other sensitive data. Kaspersky advises users to avoid
storing sensitive information in their Photo Library to mitigate the risk.

 To save you a click, the affected apps are ComeCome, WeTink, and AnyGPT. 
 
     They’re testing to see what they can get by Apple.

     Thank you!

     Thank you.  Who actually uses these apps? Would like to know

     Any way to check your phone for this, in case it is included with other apps too?



 Assuming not giving apps full access to photo is a good way to mitigate risk. 
 
     Yeah this is the way. Allowing any app to have full access to your library is insanity.

     EU: NO WAY



 Calling it “Screen Reading” is disingenuous 
 
     Agreed, I thought these apps were able to view a live feed of the screen 

     How would you describe it?



 Teams?

 You set a time limit on voice memos? Exactly how much of a problem do you have
talking to yourself? 
 
     Right?! I can understand a time limit on Calculator, but Voice Memos?



 Some people can’t quite ignore the limit if they are kids/under 14. 
 
     So it's a feature implemented mostly for Juniors?



 i mean, if you suffer from time blindness and hyperfocus it’s certainly helpful
just to get a reminder that you might be overdoing it. and i totally love the
you have options on how to ignore it… i never go for the ""today"" option though…
way too dangerous with certain apps. 
 


 i set the limits and then developed the reflex to immediately ignore it when it
pops up. 
 
     i did this. then set a passcode so it takes slightly more effort, got quick at that, now i have an app
    called screenzen that sets limits for app opens per day and locks you out after



 I made my girlfriend set the passcode and I set hers, so we both don’t doom
scroll too much 
 
     So how do you use your phone when you're not together?

     damn thats actually a great idea



 On a good day I’ll hit 15 minutes about twice, then just ignore it for the day.😔 
 
     Verily, man’s will is but a reed, bending ’neath the weight of every passing wind.



 I don't use them 
 


 I have mine set for things like Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
Usually when it pops up after my time has expired, I will put the phone down or
do something else, but, if I'm in the middle of reading or responding to
something I actually am interested in, then I'll hit the remind me in 15.
Usually once my apps time out, I do respect it for the most part, but sometimes
if I'm watching TV or waiting on a loading screen in whatever game I'm playing,
I'll pick up my phone between commercials and hit the ignore. But, because I'm
doing it to check on things during a finite period of time, I rarely continually
hit the Remind me or Ignore. 
 
     It's always good to have a routine. And it seems you got yours.



 I just hit “ignore”. P.S., I ❤️ your posted image. Check out my Garmin watch
face! 🤣  https://preview.redd.it/6fcannwz3j2f1.jpeg?width=1934&format=pjpg&auto=

 Um, that’s good when you’re able to ignore

My daughter uses way more screen time than she has.,"My daughter uses way more screen time than she has.

The situation is as follows: She has an iPhone and iPad and the account she has
is part of a family account. I let her have 2 hour of screen time per day and
she can use all apps she wants (she needs to ask permission to download apps)  I
noticed that she uses waaaay more screen time than she has. Yesterday she was
well over 2 hours on both the iPad and iPhone. I believe she doubled her screen
time. This happens more often than not.  I am 100% sure she doesn't bypass
anything to get more screen time. So, what could be the issue?

 And change the code….regularly. My kids are fantastic spies and guessers.
Also, if you child is still young enough, just physically take devices away, set
a timer on your own phone.   Make her ask to use it, emphasize that it’s yours,
not “hers”   (Saying it because I wish I was stricter with my youngest on this.
I was quite strict with my oldest, and a bit looser with my middle child….then
far too easy with my youngest….be smarter than I was, please!) 
 
     Some really good parent advice, thanks! I changed the code just in case :)



 Just FYI there is a bug that my 7 year old told me about. If he’s at the screen
time limit and he reboots the iPad it resets and he gets an extra half hour or
something. You can do it as much as you want. 
 
     Yeah this is it.

     They say ravens are as smart as the average 7 year old.  I believe it now. The Raven would have never
    given away that valuable secret. 



 [deleted] 
 
     Hmm where can i find that option?



 My Occam's razor theory: You daughter knows the screen time passcode. Just
change it.   For instance she can guess it an unlimited amount of times if she
goes to settings > general > transfer or reset iPhone > erase all content and
settings > continue > enter passcode for her iPhone > then it will ask to enter
the  screen time passcode. She can guess an unlimited amount of times there and
then she only needs to cancel the process afterward. 
 
     There is a setting now to send you a notification when the password is used

     I changed the code just in case. Thanks



 We have the same issue with our daughter. We change our daughter’s screen time
password multiple times a month, but she still manages to use more than the
allocated time for some apps. I think it must be some bug because she also uses
two devices 😩 
 
     Latest update sends you a notification every time the screen time passcode is used, so that can help
    figure things out. Unfortunately, there are also TONS of screen time bugs that have persisted for years
    and don't seem to get fixed. So it could be both!



 Certain apps seem to bypass any screen time limits. Roblox is a habitual
offender.  
 
     wait really? they def do that on purpose lmao

     Having this issue right now. So goddamn annoying



 what worked for us is not telling the password to the device, and unlocking it
for her, when she was allowed to use it 
 


 What a coincidence 
 


 Have you turned on the block apps when limit is reached? Otherwise they can
click ignore on their iPhone or ipad, and continue to use it. 
 


 So the screen time in my kids phone has not been blocking Roblox and YouTube
lately. He is not bypassing it and does not know the code, it just does not
work. I’ve tried pretty much everything to fix this.

 It might be the thing with stacking devices. However, there’s a bug that messes
with Screen time, having unreasonable amount of time showing there with other
apps (including screenshots) on 20 hours+ even though you could have that app
opened for only like minute.   *Go to Settings - Screen Time - (swipe down) and
you can turn off ‘share across devices’ or turn off the whole Screen Time
feature.*  Then turn it back on and see if apps you had opened will be there
again, having the time increasing even though they are not running.

"Why does ""Screen Mirroring"" keep forcing itself onto my control center?","Why does ""Screen Mirroring"" keep forcing itself onto my control center?

This post isn't a joke, I swear. I was messing around with the ability to add
multiple of the same button (flashlight) for fun to the control center, the
place you go whenever you swipe downwards from your battery icon to quickly
change settings like your brightness, and I noticed something odd. After
forgetting I spent 5 minutes making a cursed tab entirely of flashlights, I kept
noticing occasionally that every time I open this specific tab, the screen
mirroring option keeps forcing itself onto here. For context, I removed the
screen mirroring button once I learned I could customize what buttons appear and
where for my control center because I don't have TV that allows that. It keeps
showing up every time I remove it and replace it with a different button, it's
super weird. Can anyone explain why this keeps happening?

the site for that long. Secondly, I watch youtube through safari, not the app so
it shouldn’t even be listed up there. I also don’t watch that much youtube.
Other relevant information:  -I don’t keep my phone on when i’m sleeping so why
the daily average chart shows activity for all hours, I don’t know.  -My usual
screen time would be around 11 hours. The bulk of it should be safari because I
will play podcasts as background noise through my day.   How anyone else
experienced this or has an explanation on why this happens? Is there any way to
get it back to normal?

Screen Time App Limits Keep Resetting,"Screen Time App Limits Keep Resetting

Title is pretty self explanatory, my kids have an iPad, Apple Watch, and an
account on an iMac, and at least once a week portions of, or all of screen time
resets. The settings are just gone (across all devices) and the kids get
unfettered access to everything again.   I thought it was an issue with them
guessing the code, but I have changed it multiple times and the most recent time
to something that I've never used for anything else (not even my wife knew it
this time) and made sure to be extra cautious when entering in the code to hide
it from them.   Has anyone else seen this?

 Happening to us too since iOS 16.  We never had problems before, but now I can
set the limits/content restrictions and they turn off sometimes within 30
minutes.  We have tried moving them to another family and moving them back with
no success.  It’s super frustrating when we have relied on these settings for
years.  We aren’t sure what to try next, so if anyone has a solution that worked
let me know. 
 
     This is still happening even halfway through 2024 on iOS 17, is this still happening to you as well?

     We found our problem. Our kids big had an account in our iMac that they rarely used. I logged in and sure
    enough system preferences was asking us to update Apple ID settings. We did, and haven’t had screen time
    issues since.



 Yeah this is ridiculous, I can set app limits, go back one page and then go back
to the app limits and its a random assortment of times no one ever set. 
 


 All. The. Fucking. Time.   Both kids. 
 
     I called support… turn off and turn on again… smh

     Can you call support, it sounds like it’s a bug, but not a known one - so the more cases they have the
    higher priority it will get.



 Well, I thought I was going crazy or my kid was messing with the app limits and
downtime. So very frustrating that this KNOWN issue is not being resolved. Like
so many, we chose apple for our child bc of the ability to put of time guard
rails. 
 


 I’m having the same problem on all my kids devices since I upgraded to an iPhone
14 pro. I’m the organizer and I have 3 kids devices they are all on 15.7. My
iPhone is on 16.1. Maybe this has something to do with it? I set up app limits
and always allowed on each device and sometimes it last for a day or maybe just
and hour and then I check and boom it’s all back to default! It’s maddening.
Worked fine before I got my new phone. I’m thinking it’s something to do with
not being on the same iOS version. But problem is their devices are too old to
update to iOS 16 and they are stuck on 15 so not sure what to do?! 
 
     Ugh. I’m upgrading my kids to 16.1 this weekend and Apple is supposed to call back on Monday. Fingers
    crossed.



 I am going mad with this. Both my kids iPhones are doing it. Looks like I just
need to go back “to old good times” to just physical phone limitation. I don’t
think 16.2 will fix it. 
 


 I have the same issue, though it seems to only be app limits that gets reset,
everything else stays fine and it seems to randomly revolve around approving
additional time.  That is usually when I notice my son has been on it for hours
and am like wtf.  See that all app limits are gone.  Go back and put it all back
in and it seems to last until he is using something and requests additional time
and I grant it, then it wipes out the app limits.  Maddening. 
 
     This is still happening even halfway through 2024 on iOS 17, is this still happening to you as well?

     I too only noticed it’s the app limits and sometimes content restrictions that get reset. The downtime
    stays the same…. So frustrating!



 I can report the same as everybody else. Started awhile back, sometime around
iOS16 but I can’t pinpoint the exact date. It will work for a few hours or even
a day or two, but every time it resets.   It’ll even reset content restrictions
to allow adult websites with no restrictions. It’s insane. 
 


 Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one wondering if I'm crazy. I have three kids on
apple, and am having the same issue. Downtime works fine, but all the app limits
just disappear. For now, phones are being turned in at night and no phones
allowed in rooms. Hopefully someone updates this thread when the bug is
resolved! 
 
     Pretty sick of this... we get maybe 24 hours of everything working before everything resets. I have had
    one instance where all the downtime settings turned off. And today all the ""allowed all the time"" apps
    disappeared. SUPER tired of this!      Meanwhile, I have talked to local friends and they were so glad to
    know they weren't the only ones with the issue. We need to get a lot of people to get ahold of the right
    people at apple so they can fix this bug. I think the majority of parents are clueless that it's happening
    OR they think their kid has been doing some sneaky workaround.



 same problem here...anyone has a workaround ? 
 
     So this time when I disabled and re-enabled I was prompted with a bunch of new screens, so I’m not sure if
    something changed. It hasn’t reset yet and it’s been 24 hours. Fingers crossed?

bottom of app scroll down to a section labelled subscriptions and unsubscribe

 When you went to that website did you click any pop ups that asked you to

Confused about how Screen Time is supposed to work with Safari,"Confused about how Screen Time is supposed to work with Safari

I’ve finally gotten around to experimenting with Screen Time on my iPhone. I’m a
little confused as to how it works:  Settings > Screen Time > Downtime > I’ve
set it to Scheduled, Everyday, 8AM to 8PM.   Settings > Screen Time > Always
Allowed > I’ve added all apps to always allowed except App A and App B.   I
haven’t touched App Limits.   Now, when I open Safari and go to any website or
press any link it says “Time Limit - you’ve reached your limit on Website X”. I
then have to press Ignore.   The only two apps I want to limit access between
8AM and 8PM are App A and App B. So at say 9AM why are all websites in Safari
being blocked? I’m on iOS 15.2. Found a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/c
omments/9it6in/how_to_disable_time_limit_prompts_in_safari/) and [another](https
://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/9vlv7u/question_how_do_i_stop_this_ive_enabled_
the/) from 3 years ago describing same issue.

 I asked apple support about this and they told me that it is not currently
possible to allow all websites. He and his seniors wer surprised that this
wasn't possible though and he told me that they would forward it to the
engineering or technical team to bring this feature in the next update. So maybe
it will be possible in one of the next updates 
 
     A year later and yet

     Thanks for doing the investigation, I’m glad I’m not crazy. Yes hopefully they will address this in the
    future it seems like a very odd choice for them to have made, it’s almost like as if Screen Time was not
    really thought through.

     Any follow up? Still happens to me in iOS 17.01 😭

     2 years later and I’m here because it hasn’t been fixed. I’m currently trying to get rid of some app
    addictions but if Safari is not working that’s just pure bs lmao.

     three years later and it still hasn’t changed 😪 was hoping this thread was gonna help me out

     Still not possible and driving me crazy. I have to use chrome during my downtime and drives me nuts
    because I prefer safari on my phone.

     Been 3 years and it's still not available 😂

     Either he got fired, or he deserves to. It’s 2025, and his team still sucks.

     three years later i’m so tired of having to switch to a different browser app after 9pm 😭😭😭😭 this is truly
    ridiculous

     This shit is so dumb

     This is still a problem 4 years later so. great work Apple!

     Three years later. Still not changed

     Reading this in November 2023 trying to find a solution, no solution has been granted as of iOS 17.1.1

     730+ days into the future…. still no cure.



 Amazing how this is still a problem 
 
     Even a year later!

     Still a problem! Shocked you can’t just have safari as an app on always allow.



 This is an old post but I got around it by downloading chrome and using that as
my primary web app 
 
     Lmao thank you for this simple brilliance. Much appreciated

     LOL!

     Works fine for general browsing, but this doesn’t work with in-app browsers.



 August 2024 and it still doesn’t work omg I’m so frustrated 
 


 It's amazing what could be an awesome iOS feature for use with a child's school
iPad/etc. could be so incredibly broken at the final hurdle. Real shame, but at
least I know I'm not going crazy - been trying to solve this for days - seems
it's just not possible.   Might have to go the ""Install Chrome"" route. 👍 
 


 Still a problem. Just wanted to block social media apps during the day so I
could be productive but apparently apple is dogshit so if I want to look i up I
have to click “ignore” every 5 minutes 
 


 Let me be the first to say… Here we are in 2025 with this problem! Just
downloaded Chrome. 
 
     so about that… ios 26 kills that workaround!!! love it!!



 March 2025 and it’s still not fixed 
 


 Decided to just switch to Firefox on Iphone to avoid the hassle

 My guess is you have more than one device signed into that Apple ID. You can
actually turn it off it’s called share across devices. Then it will only do the
screen time for said device

 I’ve never confirmed myself, but screentime across all your Apple devices add

     Yeah but near 30hr !!

 You’ve confused misc databases for sure , sorry likely not any quick fix there

"""It's Not Just You - The iOS Keyboard is Broken""","""It's Not Just You - The iOS Keyboard is Broken""

This video has made me feel very vindicated because ive been consatntly feeling
like my phone screen must have a crack in it or something because of the amount
of times it simply hasnt inputted a character ive clearly tapped.     Anyone
else experienced more typos since iOS 26?

 This was the first thing I noticed about iOS 26. My typing immediately got
worse. 
 
     I thought it was because I switched from a smaller phone to a pro max or the screen protector I’m using
    but I’m glad I ain’t the only one with this problem. Even in iOS 18 I’ve had issues

     And it was already bad. I thought it was my old ass outdated iPhone, but then I got a 17 and the keyboard
    just sucks. 

     Oddly, i’ve had a reverse experience, and iOS 26 has got better for me.    Up until that point I thought I
    was just getting old, and worse at typing! Haha

     Same

     I’ve noticed this behavior since the release of iOS 18, and it’s been a bit frustrating.

     The video says it was present on the last version too though.



 What pisses me off a fair amount is the laggy-ness that sometimes ruins my
typing.  I can't pinpoint a reason or what triggers it, but it's extremely
frustrating. 
 
     I have the same phone and am experiencing the same issue it's super irritating.

     Coming from android where this isn’t an issue - this needs to get fixed. I think part of it has to do with
    the fact that if you type too fast, the vibration motor skips a buzz for one of your typed letters, making
    you feel like you missed something or that it’s lagging. It seems like something so hard to mess up,
    especially since the iPhone vibration engines are some of the best.  Also, idk if it’s me but I feel like
    the time from when you touch a key to the vibration is longer than my Samsung and pixel. Quite
    frustrating, really.

     And I thought I was the only one.... Because on my S22 Ultra, typing is super snappy!

     Same thing happens to me as well. It's brutal. Haven't found a way around it yet.

     I have the exact same phone and same issue. Its driving me insannnneee



 The iPhone typing and autocorrect have been badly broken for years. It seems to
get worse with each release. 
 
     My lord. My iPhone experience (2 years) has made me really angry with how bad keyboards can be lol. It
    ALWAYS gets the suffix wrong with the auto-suggest. Like it will provide a version of a word that doesn’t
    make sense grammatically in the context I’m typing in



 It's fucking pathetic that a company that is worth nearly $4 TRILLION dollars
can't get the keyboard right. Throw a few billion at it, you won't miss it 
 
     Wife got me to switch from a life of Samsung a few years ago, bought the flagship for $1400(?), just paid
    off and time to upgrade.   This iOS and how it affects my typing will single-handedly be the reason I
    switch back to Samsung and never come back.   My keyboard freezes in the middle of typing long write ups
    and I have to close the app and type it all again. The auto correct seems way worse. The thing where you
    hold the spacebar to move the cursor doesn’t land in the left side sometimes. It doesn’t highlight text
    errors. And this video proves to my wife that I’m not crazy as I told her it was messing me up.   I can
    deal with apps freezing (though this used to be where apple was better than the others), I can deal with
    it bogging down and needing everything to be closed or the phone to be reset (again where apple used to be
    better). I can deal with Bluetooth connectivity issues with headphones (apple used to be bulletproof on
    this).   I need to type fast and not have a ton of errors so I don’t have to edit everything.   Heading to
    switch next weekend. What a bummer.   Steve Jobs has to be rolling in his grave.



 I cannot reproduce this specific issue with either new or the old keyboard in
iOS 26.  But I do agree that the keyboard has just become a shit show, but that
was since iOS 18. Autocorrect is too jumpy sometimes, and it inserts space for
no reason breaking words in the process. It also doesn't recognize basic
spellings.  iOS keyboards were one of the best back in the day. The smooth
cursor movement and accurate typing was amazing and worked like magic. It was as
good as old SwiftKey before MS took over the app.  Apple, please stop every
other bug fixes and just work on the keyboard for a month and iron out all of
the issues and make it great again. I am sure no one will mind it. It's one of
the most used tools on a phone and it can't be a shitshow like this. 
 
     I literally just had the keyboard autocorrect “small ones would” to “small one ax would” after I finished
    typing and hit space. WTF? Why would that ever be something that seems likely at all, let alone more
    likely than “small ones would”?

     It wasn’t since iOS 18. The keyboard has been broken since at least iOS 12 back when this switch to a
    predictive keypress mechanism

     This is the most surprising thing to me. How has the keyboard gotten worse when they had the formula
    already? I use Gboard and haven't used the apple keyboard in years, but every once in a while I'll give it
    a go for a message and it's just so bad. I remember the early versions being so much better

     Tried and also cannot reproduce this, which is very interesting.



 It’s just the premium Apple experience  /s 
 


 God damn. I thought I just sucked at spelling. 
 


 OMG so its not just me, I have so many times the spacebar doesn’t trigger 
 
     I'm still on iOS 15 and it does the same. After watching this video, I disabled predictive text and now
    its much better. Give that a try.



 If Apple made the keyboard truly exceptional it would take a lot of wind out the
sails of the Android/iOS debate. That’s one of the sticking point for a lot of
people who otherwise prefer iPhones, but hate the keyboard and how crippled even
3rd party ones are.

 I’ve tried restarting my phone and clearing the cache for safari already and it

according to the screen time data 
 


 You just lost my respect and I lost faith in humanity 🫩 
 
     3 hours and 23 minutes that could’ve been spent making friends with a real person.. 🙃



 Either a bug (very common with Screen Time) or a lot of websites you visit use
Recaptcha. 
 


 that might be correct. lots of websites are using google recaptcha.  and in many
places google is outright banned (as it should be) so they use
[recaptcha.net](http://recaptcha.net) domain 
 
     The thing is that recaptcha.net was not in my screen time up until a few weeks ago and i haven’t changed
    my browsing habits much so how does it randomly pop up one day?



 This issue seems to be fixed with beta of 26.1 I am running. 
 


 I’m also seeing a lot of screentime on recaptcha the last few weeks. Interesting
that someone else is having the same issue with the same website as I am 
 
     Same issue every day.  Even when not using internet and all cookies wiped.  Even times not using my phone.
    Tried to block it for zero seconds o hours.   It still shows up for minutes to hours.



 Ios 26 made a change in how screentime worked. This meant that apps using
recaptcha started having that usage show up in screentime.   We fixed it in our
most recent SDK, but individual apps need to adopt that new SDK and then
rerelease.   Source: I manage the recaptcha SDK at Google.

     Same I used to request time and sneak to my parents phone to approve brave all day and I had all sites
    usable till this stupid update the shiny glass is not worth it



 Same here on 26.0.1.  Screen time locks all apps, even if a huge (eg. 18 hr)
allowance is granted.   This only affects macOS - an iPhone on the same iCloud
account unlocks correctly. 
 


 This is a safety issue. I want my 7 year old to be able to FaceTime or message
at any time. What if something happened to her mom or I and she was the only one
home? 
 


 Still same in 26.1. 
 


 Still same on 26.2 beta. Any app that relies on content from app is blocked even
if ""always allowed"". I can't see statistics in Kindle app, I can't use
StoryGraph for tracking books, can't use Amazon app to shop at all etc etc. Fuck
iOS26, it's the worst system they ever released. Liquid Glass is ugly AF, Screen
Time is completely broken, pasting text in Safari is a nightmare, keyboards are
glitching (always switching to US keyboard from any other even though I don't
even have US keyboard added) etc. So bad.

I find iOS 26 to be an abomination that I’m hard pressed to even understand how
this could’ve been released. It feels like a horribly bad beta. The interface is
an abomination safari is hobbled. It looks and feels like they’ve  made changes
just to make changes without any real thought into how it might affect the
general users experience. There’s constant lags and freezes. You can press the
same on screen button five times and on the sixth time it finally actuates. I do
have to blame myself for not having read reviews or done much research before
installing totally my bad please don’t make the same mistake I’ve made it’s
truly bad.

 it’s really bad. performance issues, needs lots of memory free space, some apps
display not correctly, problems connecting bluetooth devices including apple’s
own beats and the list goes on 
 
     Yeah, 15 ProMax and now it overheats and runs through the battery way faster, even weeks after installing.
    Battery saver mode now causes horrendous lag like I’m running on 20 year old hardware too.



 Wait for 26.1 (possibly this coming week). I have the release candidate and it
works pretty well both on my iPhone and iPad. 26.0 had a bunch of glitches in my
experience. The 26.1 betas were more stable for me 
 
     Does the keyboard still hide the input field behind itself?  This bug drives me insane. Blind typing with
    that trash keyboard is intense...

     Same here 26.1 works butter smooth

     Im also on 26.1 RC and there are still many bugs and it even has some new bugs tho. The bunch of wallpaper
    issues for example are still all there.

     Nah, i always wait a couple months and look at reviews and complaints before updating.   My phone is
    working fine, why would I risk that?

     26.1 might not fix much, wait until .6 or .5

     Disagree! I'm on the release candidate and it is not very good. it's very laggy and mid battery life for
    me!



 It’s the most buggy iOS release I ever encountered and I’m an iPhone user since
the OG 2G. The crashing and lagging is unheard of. I don’t understand how a
company like Apple approved this release. 
 
     iOS7 was waaaaaay worse. I don't know what you're talking about. If your phone keeps crashing and lagging
    try again. Do a fresh install and try again. If you're really using an iPhone user since the OG then you
    should know this.

thread. You can’t read or scroll up the text thread to actually see the the most

 Wish I had known before updating. I’ve gotten used to it now but I still hate
it. 
 


 I hated it for about 30 minutes, regretted upgrading. Didn't have any
performance issues though. But after about an hour I got used to everything I
hated. I still don't like several of the design choices, but I adapted to them
all pretty quickly. 
 
     Biggest aggravation for me is they moved the “new text message” button from the top to bottom. My muscle
    memory hasn’t caught up yet.

     This is probably the normal adoption process for normal folks assuming you’re not someone who actually
    likes it. The rest is just kinda noise and complaints (some well deserved, sure) but it is not nearly as
    bad as these people making these posts make it seem. They’re just the loudest voices.

     Literally, most people are blowing this up. It’s like they’re trying to become a viral post lol

     Yeah after a bit you basically forget it’s even different. I didn’t like the safari redesign until I found
    out you can swipe up from the url bar to get to the tabs. 



 It just feels so laggy and unfinished 
 
     And I have a 17pro

     Crazy, I have a 16 plus and it’s smooth as butter for me.

     Agreed



 The auto correct is also complete ass. Does stuff that makes no Sense 
 
     Mine would always change “going” to “doing” even though going is the correct word.

     Welcome to ""Apple Intelligence""

     That has been worsening over the last 3-4 years.  I don’t think autocorrect is a feature of the OS,
    anymore than Siri is. They are OS components that behave poorly on all versions. I was awful in iOS 18,
    too.



 I have it installed on my phone and it works flawlessly, I love it, I have no
complaints at all 
 
     Most feel the same. Complainers are always louder than praisers.

     The only complaints I have are that the Bluetooth menu has a big glitch where my devices wont connect half
    the time and then the battery life sucks now. I have the iPhone 15 plus for reference. Battery would last
    me forever before the update

     Same. I’m on an iPhone 14 Pro and the upgrade has been perfectly fine for me.

     I agree. I did a clean install on my new phone rather than a restore and I think that has a lot to do with
    it. I think restored can bring some old baggage along with it and cause bugs, sluggishness, etc.

     ""works flawlessly"". I don't believe you!  Every device on iOS 26 I've seen suffers from glitches and
    microstutter.  edit: People here are either delusional, lying fanboys, or have terrible vision. Yes, ALL
    devices on iOS 26 have issues! Even the iPhone 17 Pro stutters and have tons of visual glitches. It's so
    insanely obvious! If you honestly can't see it, you need to get your eyes checked!

 Programming math is hard. Time math is harder, okay.   Screen time never worked
right in any way at least since iOS 18.  
 
     It def was broken before when I checked all devices tab, but it worked well (at least seemingly) for
    iPhone only



 Clearing safari data would erase some of that screen time (but also log you out
of your websites). Do you turn off your phone at night? Since iOS 18, a lot of
people have reported their screen time going up while the device is turned off. 
 
     I’ll try the safari thing. And I don’t turn off my phone, but thank you for letting me and others who can
    stumble here know!



 Do u see a “setup” in your screen time? 
 
     Nope :/



 I hopped on Reddit to report this issue as well (since Apple Discussions is
pretty useless and I’m not aware of an official place to submit iOS bugs).  I
restarted yesterday once I saw this silliness thinking that an app, background
service, cookie, etc could be causing things to be hung up, but the issue is
persistent.  This has to be a build bug and if not, then there must be some
consistent app causing this issue (not a Twitter user, btw). 
 
     Same here, restart didn’t help. Also iirc there’s a way to report bugs to Apple directly, I don’t remember
    where now :/



 Might be a bug, try restarting. Really curious though, Why did you open x.com on
your iPhone instead of just using the app? 
 
     I don’t have the app because I hate a lot about it and one of those things is the app icon 🙃 I will try
    restarting, thank you!

 Set a 1 minute limit? 
 


 Set it for 1 minute and try it. Thats the only way I’ve gotten it to work.
That being said, a better workaround is to create a shortcut that closes the app
when you open it.   I did this with Uber Eats at one point lol… went as far as
to have it automatically close the app, open my budgeting app and then read out
the remaining calorie allotment from my tracking app lol… just to really hammer
it in. I mean I’m 60lbs down so there’s that but yea  I haven’t tried it, but
you could try to hide the app after main g the shortcut. I’m not sure how it
handles those apps tho so I’m not sure if it would even work but yea the best
way I can think is screen time for 1m (I never had success with less than 1m)
then an automatic close of the app immediately upon opening (set up as an
automation not a standard shortcut)

     Just tried this. Works pretty well!  My iPhone 11 does have a little hiccup when switching from app to the
    Home Screen but it does change from white to black after about a second.

     But that depends on what wallpaper you’re using.

     I tried it myself just now and strangely it inverts my lock screen for one second but then it goes to
    normal once my screen turns on. Could be a bug in iOS. Not gonna lie I do like this color though,

 There’s a conspiracy theory that Apple wants you to use dark backgrounds to save
up the battery, Dave 2D talks about it in his iPhone 14 Pro review. 
 
     Yet they removed the dim wallpaper option

     Idiots will believe anything they’re told.



 bro your wallpaper just blinded me 
 


 I use an app called Clarity. I find a wallpaper I like, then I use the mask
option to darken the top portion. I mainly use it so it kind of hides the notch
but it also makes the contrast higher so you can read the time and other info. 
 
     I came here to say exactly this!



 I’ve reported it on Feedback on iOS beta many times but they keep ignoring it.
It’s like the keyboard sound bug. You’ll have to learn to live with it because
they’ll never fix it. 
 


 I was about to ask “what do you mean? I can see the black numbers just fine”
then I realized that those were the numbers from *my* phone lol 
 


 Having the same problem here.  I had to edit my wallpaper and literally the only
“solution” was to paint the top of my wallpaper in a black shade, in order to be
able to see the time and battery info.

Hello everyone, I just noticed something strange in my Screen Time report: a
website called “pagead2.googlesyndication.com” supposedly used 46 minutes of my
screen time.  From what I’ve read online, it’s related to Google’s ad tracking
system, but it seems odd that it’s showing up in Screen Time at all. Before the
iOS 26 update, I never saw this.  Does anyone know what could explain this?

iOS 26 update is ruining screen time!!,"iOS 26 update is ruining screen time!!

Hi, I’m 17 and have screen time on my Apple devices and I’ve had no problem with
it all these years until I updated to this STUPID NEW IOS 26 UPDATE!!! Like
honestly the only reason I did it was cause it seemed cool and honestly it was
until I saw what it did to my screen time. Ok for context with screen time for
me, I have everything locked at 9:00 pm besides google, chrome and a few other
apps and I liked it like that, and I also have no content and privacy
restrictions at all, keep that in mind. So why is it that once my screen time
hit, the moment I tried to search up anything, or click on any website, it hit
me with screen time???? And I had both apps unlocked indefinitely?? And that’s
not even the worse part. On non web browser apps I had unlocked, when they had
ads or anything with a web browser, it wouldn’t automatically be blocked as well
even though, like I said, I had them unlocked?? So I’m honestly so confused and
frustrated and feel dumb for trying out this new update early, and it’s honestly
disappointing cause I really like some of the new features of this update and I
really hope they fix it soon, cause if I see no changes I’m downgrading back to
18.

 Unfortunately you can’t downgrade to 18 anymore. 
 
     Crap🤦‍♀️I’m really regretting updating now…



 Cold comfort but my 13 mini (Australia) currently running on 18.5 is showing
18.7 and 26 available for download. 
 
     😭that’s exactly what I saw before I updated and instead of simply choosing 18.7 I decided to rush all the
    way to 26🤦‍♀️



 Restraint and patience. Good thing I chose to stay with 18.7 
 


 So you’re upset the screen time got fixed on iOS 26? 
 
     And the new 1 minute screen time got worse as well🤦‍♀️

     It didn’t get “fixed” it’s literally broken dude🙄 like I have google and chrome unlocked yet they’re still

loaded a custom dns or is using a vpn of some sort. This will block Apple for
time syncing but will allow findmy to still be used.  Time zone - are you
automatically or manually setting time in date & time? If it’s not automatic, he
could be changing that.  Random apps - any random apps installed that look sus?

simple process, all you need is a cable, the unlocked phone and the apple
devices app on a computer, the screen time pin is not required to reset the
phone, simply create a new icloud account  2. my dad took my phone and put
screen time back on it and he tried to remove my old account (no longer linked
to any device) but accidentally turned off screen time on my current account.

     Why you snitching?!

     Happy cake day I guess



 My partner’s child kept getting round screen time, and I put it down to screen
time being naff. We eventually figured out that she knew the code (that we kept
changing). The code was on a shared note and was on our devices. She knew her
mum’s PIN for her iPad and was going through her stuff.  
 
     wdym round and naff?



 The only way I found is to erase the iPad and restore it from a backup, which
solved the issue for me.  Tried with Apple support, and pretty much they are
useless. 
 


 ive heard of people turning on screen record just before its unlocked so that
they can see the pin that their parents put in 
 
     That’s pretty clever! Couldn’t be the cause in this case though because I manage it from my device.



 Best to monitor rather than limit. 
 
     Not always possible with my work schedule. Setting a cutoff on school nights prevents any shenanigans. No
    temptations to try to sneak access, no need for me to check throughout the night. Not sure what the
    problem is.

     This is not true. You need to limit AND monitor. Teens do not need open access to social media platforms
    or their phone in general. They need limits! App time limits. Phone limits. Contact limits. The works.
    Parents who are not limiting AND monitoring their teens and preteens phones are doing them a disservice.
    Just look at the link between phones and teen suicide. It’s out of control.



 Back when I was a teen and it was called restrictions, I got past it with a
YouTube tutorial that showed me how to access the raw files of my phone by
plugging it into my computer, find an encrypted version of the password, then
run it through a website that tried every possible combination until it matched.
Probably not helpful for your case, but my point is if your son’s tech savvy,
he’ll always find a way.

Screen time- useless?,"Screen time- useless?

Any ideas on how to fix screen time?  My teen told me that the last 2 nights her
screen time has not been functioning as intended. She should not be able to do
most apps after a certain time. At that point, the blocked apps go gray. She
showed me that now she can open a gray/blocked app and a message comes up that
says something like ""you have reached your limit for this app. Override?"" And
then she can override and get another 15 minutes on the app.  It was not like
this a few days ago.  We turned our phones on and off and messed with some
settings but it's still happening.  Also, I have calls blocked after a certain
time but I wanted to allow her to Get calls from me and a couple other family
members anytime- I add us to the list but then the names disappear from The list
as soon as I leave that page.  She self-reported this bug to me. I do not
believe she is just trying to get more screen time. She is trying to show she is
trustworthy because she knows I will take away this phone if she is not
trustworthy about screen time limits.

 Apple screen time is very buggy. It will bug out often… or randomly claim you
spent 50 hours on an app in one day (not a joke by the way). It’s not as bad a
Microsoft Family Safety though. That thing is literally the easiest set of
controls to bypass.  Did you try to set a screen time password? You can set a
pin on the phone. As long as you don’t tell the teen she won’t be able to access
the apps. It should be labeled Lock Screen time settings. Then if she wants more
time she can ask you, and you can put in the pin. And the latest version of iOS
also sends a notification to the parents if the pin is used, assuming that’s set
up (which idk how to do, as up until recently I still had parental controls on
my phone, and I don’t have anyone I need to block access from).

Pretty disappointed Apple promoted lock screen widgets for months and I can only fit 2 widgets on my screen… (not a fan of the small ones that would give me a whopping 4),"Pretty disappointed Apple promoted lock screen widgets for months and I can only fit 2 widgets on my screen… (not a fan of the small ones that would give me a whopping 4)



 What bugs me about it is the fact that the majority of small widgets are...
mostly useless.  The only really useful ones are the large widgets which you can
only fit two of. 
 
     And the weather one doesn't seem to update to current temps

     I like how the colour coded fitness rings are only available in monochrome as a widget (as far as I can
    tell)

     They feel utterly useless for anyone with an Apple Watch.   I honestly can’t see a reason to use them when
    most of them fit on most watch faces.

     Exactly. And there’s a bug (at least with mine) that if I want to see more available widgets I have to
    manually open each individual app before going to customize Home Screen to get the available widget to
    show up. All these widgets are awful and like you said useless. I still don’t understand why there isn’t
    more/can move them around to other parts of the screen. Some people don’t care about blocking their
    background photo /lot of people just use colors anyway. Plus notification bar at the bottom now which I
    personally like, so now I just have an empty square with nothing

     You can also use the box above the time to show you things like weather, activity or Calendar. I realise
    it’s not more widgets but it should allow you to put more information in the widgets below if you use the
    top for weather or something like that?

     The stock widgets are garbage. I ended up installing Launcher to create useful ones.

     And i dont particularly like the big one leaving a big gap in the middle of the 2 widget.

     Weather one requires location to be on at all times too. Homescreen one has an option to select a city



 Idk how people are complaining about this, I can't even find 4 that are actually
useful. 
 
     If you have a watch they are all quite redundant, and despite the large screen of the phone, somehow show
    *less* information.

     -       I go out often so the weather widget is a must -       It also rains here frequently and I dress
    according to the weather  The two above takes at least 2 spaces and at max 3  -       I work with another
    country, so I use at least 1 time widget  -       My last widget is a mood/diary tracker  —-  For work
    mode, I use 2 widgets: -       reminders -       multiple time zones  —-  For bed time, I use 3 widgets -
    multiple time zones -       fitness -       mood/diary tracker  —-  [Album of my lock
    screens](https://imgur.com/a/HnZmlcH/)  I also have my phone on a magsafe stand next to my monitor which
    makes the lock screen widgets more accessible.

     YES!!! You’re limited to so few choices.  Do you want weather at the top and bottom, got it!

     One of my widgets is literally an axolotl. Most of them are useless like you said

     Honestly, I can't find a use for widgets at all. When they launched them for the home screen I gave them a
    go for a week, but I honestly couldn't see the point. I've got one on my iPad, but I never look at it.
    It's honestly just there to take up space so that my home screen doesn't have an empty patch.  Funnily
    enough, though, I'm a big fan of complications on my watch.

     Even if they were useful they won’t update in real time

     I still can't figure out why apple makes the widget screen mandatory and you can't delete the screen if
    you're not using it. And now they make the widget screen even more redundant.



 I honestly like the small one that tells you the battery of your AirPods. Pretty
useful for me. Otherwise, the update was somewhat of a disappointment. 
 
     The battery one us nice. I also like the Apollo subreddit shortcut. I have a focus mode for when I'm
    watching my favourite sports team and it allows me to get into the game thread with two taps.

     I wish it showed the battery even when I’m not using the AirPods. Like update once an hour or something
    when I’m not using.

     Oh, I like that idea. Airpods battery would be fantastic!



 Out of topic but the Dynamic Island appear on screenshot? 
 
     Nope - which I’m glad they thought of

     Only if It’s use like when it is stretched out to show something



 i like the small ones ngl 
 
     Maybe I would if I could add more than 4?



 Welcome to Apple, I, limited customization, will be your guide 
 


 Why couldn't they take the normal widgets that they had and put them on the Lock
Screen - why create ANOTHER version of these things that are basically lame? 
 


 there have always only been 2 bigs/4 littles since the first beta. so you may be
disappointed but apple never overpromised on the feature. 
 


 I only want to use one large one and center it, is that too much to ask 
 


 Apple: ""Here's some widgets like you wanted!""  Users here: ""But there's not
enough!""  Apple: ""aight fuck you then ya complainers"" 
 
     Apple: “Here’s some widgets like you wanted!”  Users here: “But there’s not enough!”  Anyone else: “it’s
    been ten whole days”

     More like  Apple ""here's the widgets the way we think you should like them""  Users: ""could you give us the
    ability to use the ones we actually want in the way we want to""  Apple: ""no, fuck you for asking""

This is FAR from the first time this has happened to me and resulted in an
unwanted or unexpected action, but I just opened the Safari share sheet on a
news article I intended to send to my friend. I do this often enough that this
specific friend is the first suggested recipient on the share sheet. But, just
as I went to tap the icon (in the brief millisecond between my finger covering
the icon and moving towards the screen to tap), it slid to the right and was
instantly replaced by an Airdrop suggestion for my downstairs neighbor with whom
I never EVER share anything. So now, as a result, I have to explain to my
problematic, old, paranoid downstairs neighbor why I felt the need to Airdrop
her an industrial design newsletter article about a conceptual new sex toy at
9am on a Friday. Thanks Apple, you guys have really nailed the basics of digital
U/I.

 The Airdrop example is the same one I've run into too often. I will start to
Airdrop a photo or something to my laptop that's 18"" away from my phone and it
will be the first entry in the 'share to' list but if you're not quick enough,
it then changes to a generic Airdrop icon that takes you to a 2nd list of
Airdrop-capable devices within range (wife's iPhone or iPad, the kid's iPhones
and/or Apple laptops, etc). Worst is, it's not consistent if and when it will do
this. 
 
     You’re absolutely right. Although the share sheet isn’t the only place I’ve seen this happen in iOS, the
    Airdrop icon is definitely the worst offender.

     It’s arguably worse when you have the airdrop menu open and you tap on your friend’s device but it just
    populates the screen with a stranger’s device and you end up sending it to them.



 I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve gone to tap something at the top of my
screen and the instant I hit the screen a notification banner pops up and I end
up going to that app instead. I don’t know what the solution is, in terms of GUI
design, but it’s so annoying. 
 
     THIS is another perfect example of this issue, yes. Nothing is more infuriating than tapping something
    only to have something else appear there in that brief, uncontrollable moment.

     yes, this happens to me waaaay too often and what's worse, the notification disappears after that so you
    don't even get to know what you have tapped into.

     This is why I turned off banners for almost every app. Way too annoying otherwise.

     When I used a iPhone 4S that was jailbroken long time ago I had this tweak where the status bar functioned
    as a notification “window”   When receiving a text for example I could choose to have it scroll
    horizontally or vertically for instance.    Really great and notifications never got in the way

     100000000% this. I don’t know how Apple fans put up with this shit and pretend iOS is so good. It drives
    me crazy.



 I’m sweating bullets everytime I save an image from a tweet. You have to hit the
share button and circumnavigate pictures of your mom and work contacts.  Not
really though, I’m not shy about who I am. My mom even enjoys going to the
leather bar with us when she visits SF.  The most infuriating thing for me is
when every Apple TV in the building shows up in my airplay list, one at a time. 
 
     You’re absolutely right and none of us should be sweating bullets when we’re trying to navigate the U/I on
    our phones. It’s ridiculous. I left the sex toy part in there for the laugh and I definitely don’t want it
    to detract from the point of my post, but even in my usual day-to-day communications (which usually aren’t
    sex toy-related) I feel like I have to be super careful (too careful imo) not to misdirect anything I
    send. The random button movements are insane.

     >       You have to hit the share button and circumnavigate pictures of your mom and work contacts.  I
    would love it if you could choose who is there and what position they are in, but instead you can’t and
    apple has made those decisions for you, so my boss is always there :|   I straight up disabled that
    feature so I don’t accidentally send something to them.   Now there are no suggested send to people. If I
    want to message it to someone I have to manually type it.

     >       Not really though, I’m not shy about who I am. My mom even enjoys going to the leather bar with us
    when she visits SF.  At a guess she’d still probably rather not receive a kink photo from her child
    completely without warning, though.

     Feels like the problem is unwanted focus on sharing for real world contacts. It’s unlikely for you to
    share ANYTHING through iOS, yet Apple think it extremely likely, and that is leading to disasters.

     >The most infuriating thing for me is when every Apple TV in the building shows up in my airplay list, one
    at a time.  Whats your solution then cowboy



 How hard would it be to just leave that space with a disabled button if no
airdrop targets are available? ""No airdrop recipients nearby"" or something.
Apple really has me questioning their design chops sometimes 
 
     Agreed on all fronts. Not sure what’s happening in the design department at Apple recently but it’s not a
    good omen. Aside from just this issue, I’ve been having conversations about how much Apple product don’t
    “just work” any more and it’s sad. My favorite part is that if you contact Apple about these issues or go
    in to a store asking about it, they just act like your issue is a completely rare case that no one else is
    having.



 I’ve been advocating for this for years. And I’ve been android for the past like
eight years just iOS this year. It’s a problem over there too.  It will be my
number one requested feature on any major OS update.  I know it’s probably
pretty complex, but fundamentally if what I clicked has just popped up into that
location in the last few milliseconds (make it configurable), either have it not
trigger, or trigger what was there… Or make the action configurable as well.  I
get it most in a Chromecast device list. Ideally the devices would just pop in
sequentially into a list, but instead it’s almost arbitrary where they show up
and they’re popping in and out all the time it’s almost guaranteed in a house
full of casting devices to click the wrong thing. 
 
     Agreed that it happens on Android too, but I feel like Apple should be better than this dammit. I also
    don’t think it should be configurable, either figure it out before the options appear on-screen or find
    another, less intrusive way of adding options. Apple can’t keep going on about how fast their processors
    are if their U/I is too slow to process a basic share sheet before it appears on-screen.

     Not configurable. Just disable interaction for a quarter second or so. (UX testing to determine optimal
    interval.)  The more things that are configurable, the harder it is to find the thing you actually care
    about configuring.

     Setting that interval to the right value is a hard job for a UX researcher… it would be essentially
    impossible for all the other users.



 Creeping out the house in the early morning so I don’t wake my sick wife. I
remember to turn off the lamp in the lounge with my Apple Watch, open the home
app, press the button, very loud rap music from the bedroom HomePod. Thanks
Apple. 
 
     And I bet she still blamed you and not apple



 I agree, I have mentioned this to so many people, but always get a shrug and
""what's the big deal"" type of response.  Similarly, notifications.  The top
portion of the screen is a danger zone.  Ideally there'd be some sort of pre-
notification animation that doesn't react to clicks to let you know that it's
coming, at least as long as typical human reaction time. 
 
     [deleted]

     Also they need to stop putting back / navigation buttons on top.  It’s stupid.  When they moved the
    navigation bar on Safari to bottom, it was a huge relief… but apparently a bunch of people hated that…
    idiots…

     Notifications to show you're about to get a notification?

     Turn off banner-style notifications if they’re that disruptive to your life.  Solved.



 Jesus fucking thank you. Also increase hitbox size EVERYWHERE, so I can close
out/navigate as intended. I don’t understand the defenders of this UI when basic
navigation is so sloppy. It’s not just unintuitive, it’s often head-scratchingly
just not designed well and thought out. -and then just *left* that way for some
reason. 
 
     It's so nice to hear someone else say this. I came from over 10 years on Android with most of it being
    Nexus/pixel phones. Navigation and UX design on googles version of Android had gotten pretty damn amazing
    (that's before Android 12 which I haven't really used as I switched in October) and was expecting that to
    bump up a notch when switching to iOS because everyone says iOS just works and is intuitive and blah blah
    blah. Needless to say I've been very disappointed and it hasn't lived up to the hype. Many days it feels
    like so much more work using iOS then it ever did Android



 This is the worst on the YouTube app. Things load in the fraction of a second it
takes my reaction time to tap the link I want, pushing everything down a few
lines and making me go somewhere I didn’t want to. 
 
     This is honestly the case all over iOS. It happens constantly.



 An unexpected notification while I'm tapping fast in my phone has taken me to
dangerous paths, including (almost) sharing private info with random people. It
happens way too often. 
 
     Bingo. Based on a couple other comments in this thread, a beautiful and elegant solution is to disable
    siri suggestions for the share sheet. Settings>Siri & Search and disable the toggle for  “Show when
    sharing.”

Malware With Screen Reading Code Found in iOS Apps for the First Time,"Malware With Screen Reading Code Found in iOS Apps for the First Time

Summary Through Apple Intelligence: Malware called “SparkCat,” capable of
reading sensitive information from screenshots, has been discovered in iOS apps.
The malware, active since March 2024, targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but
could potentially access other sensitive data. Kaspersky advises users to avoid
storing sensitive information in their Photo Library to mitigate the risk.

 To save you a click, the affected apps are ComeCome, WeTink, and AnyGPT. 
 
     They’re testing to see what they can get by Apple.

     Thank you!

     Thank you.  Who actually uses these apps? Would like to know

     Any way to check your phone for this, in case it is included with other apps too?



 Assuming not giving apps full access to photo is a good way to mitigate risk. 
 
     Yeah this is the way. Allowing any app to have full access to your library is insanity.

     EU: NO WAY



 Calling it “Screen Reading” is disingenuous

 Worse issue is when they jump around while I'm about to tap one of them, because
I guess spotlight is still searching.     And even worse is when you tap a
result... and it opens safari and just loads the tab you already had open...
doesn't do the search, so you have to go back to spotlight and tap it again to
load it. 
 
     I thought i was the only one who has a spotlight with a mind of its own (sometimes deciding to not search
    at all)

     >       And even worse is when you tap a result… and it opens safari and just loads the tab you already
    had open… doesn’t do the search, so you have to go back to spotlight and tap it again to load it.  Omg
    this. I tried googling and couldn’t find a lot of references to this issue. But it happens at least once a
    day. Seems to not really happen if you have a different default browser set. Which makes me think it’s a
    weird bug interaction between spotlight and safari.



 This applies to the files app too. 
 


 I'm sorry, but not even Apple can fix the broken family court system. 
 


 They could do something like the news, with the sideways scrolling text 
 


 That’s because your text is 4x normal size 
 
     It also happens on normal size. Nonetheless it shouldn’t happen.

     Still happens with normal sized text. I run into this issue constantly and just click hoping it’s the
    correct suggestion.

     Last time this was posted I screnshotted what it looks like for me, even with the smallest text size on my
    12 pro.  https://reddit.com/r/ios/comments/v59sng/_/ib9bfic/?context=1

     If all it takes is a guy who wears readers to expose such an obvious UI design flaw, then whoever designed
    it is incompetent.

     I mean if I can't adjust to compensate for that then it's pretty shit.



 Apple seems convinced to make their search features as infuriating as possible.
It's not even just iOS, the results in Spotlight on macOS have been useless
since Big Sur came out. 
 
     that's why I switched to Alfred. 100x better and faster

Screen Time App Limits Keep Resetting,"Screen Time App Limits Keep Resetting

Title is pretty self explanatory, my kids have an iPad, Apple Watch, and an
account on an iMac, and at least once a week portions of, or all of screen time
resets. The settings are just gone (across all devices) and the kids get
unfettered access to everything again.   I thought it was an issue with them
guessing the code, but I have changed it multiple times and the most recent time
to something that I've never used for anything else (not even my wife knew it
this time) and made sure to be extra cautious when entering in the code to hide
it from them.   Has anyone else seen this?

 Happening to us too since iOS 16.  We never had problems before, but now I can
set the limits/content restrictions and they turn off sometimes within 30
minutes.  We have tried moving them to another family and moving them back with
no success.  It’s super frustrating when we have relied on these settings for
years.  We aren’t sure what to try next, so if anyone has a solution that worked
let me know. 
 
     This is still happening even halfway through 2024 on iOS 17, is this still happening to you as well?

     We found our problem. Our kids big had an account in our iMac that they rarely used. I logged in and sure
    enough system preferences was asking us to update Apple ID settings. We did, and haven’t had screen time
    issues since.



 Yeah this is ridiculous, I can set app limits, go back one page and then go back
to the app limits and its a random assortment of times no one ever set. 
 


 All. The. Fucking. Time.   Both kids. 
 
     I called support… turn off and turn on again… smh

     Can you call support, it sounds like it’s a bug, but not a known one - so the more cases they have the
    higher priority it will get.



 Well, I thought I was going crazy or my kid was messing with the app limits and
downtime. So very frustrating that this KNOWN issue is not being resolved. Like
so many, we chose apple for our child bc of the ability to put of time guard
rails. 
 


 I’m having the same problem on all my kids devices since I upgraded to an iPhone
14 pro. I’m the organizer and I have 3 kids devices they are all on 15.7. My
iPhone is on 16.1. Maybe this has something to do with it? I set up app limits
and always allowed on each device and sometimes it last for a day or maybe just
and hour and then I check and boom it’s all back to default! It’s maddening.
Worked fine before I got my new phone. I’m thinking it’s something to do with
not being on the same iOS version. But problem is their devices are too old to
update to iOS 16 and they are stuck on 15 so not sure what to do?! 
 
     Ugh. I’m upgrading my kids to 16.1 this weekend and Apple is supposed to call back on Monday. Fingers
    crossed.



 I am going mad with this. Both my kids iPhones are doing it. Looks like I just
need to go back “to old good times” to just physical phone limitation. I don’t
think 16.2 will fix it. 
 


 I have the same issue, though it seems to only be app limits that gets reset,
everything else stays fine and it seems to randomly revolve around approving
additional time.  That is usually when I notice my son has been on it for hours
and am like wtf.  See that all app limits are gone.  Go back and put it all back
in and it seems to last until he is using something and requests additional time
and I grant it, then it wipes out the app limits.  Maddening. 
 
     This is still happening even halfway through 2024 on iOS 17, is this still happening to you as well?

     I too only noticed it’s the app limits and sometimes content restrictions that get reset. The downtime
    stays the same…. So frustrating!



 I can report the same as everybody else. Started awhile back, sometime around
iOS16 but I can’t pinpoint the exact date. It will work for a few hours or even
a day or two, but every time it resets.   It’ll even reset content restrictions
to allow adult websites with no restrictions. It’s insane. 
 


 Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one wondering if I'm crazy. I have three kids on
apple, and am having the same issue. Downtime works fine, but all the app limits
just disappear. For now, phones are being turned in at night and no phones
allowed in rooms. Hopefully someone updates this thread when the bug is
resolved! 
 
     Pretty sick of this... we get maybe 24 hours of everything working before everything resets. I have had
    one instance where all the downtime settings turned off. And today all the ""allowed all the time"" apps
    disappeared. SUPER tired of this!      Meanwhile, I have talked to local friends and they were so glad to
    know they weren't the only ones with the issue. We need to get a lot of people to get ahold of the right
    people at apple so they can fix this bug. I think the majority of parents are clueless that it's happening
    OR they think their kid has been doing some sneaky workaround.



 same problem here...anyone has a workaround ? 
 
     So this time when I disabled and re-enabled I was prompted with a bunch of new screens, so I’m not sure if
    something changed. It hasn’t reset yet and it’s been 24 hours. Fingers crossed?

Brain storming what Apple could do to update the home screen - thoughts on mini widgets?,"Brain storming what Apple could do to update the home screen - thoughts on mini widgets?



 Apple has never touched the home screen, and I rarely use the widgets because
they are tucked away on a screen I never naturally go to. With phone screens
getting bigger and bigger, I think making better use of the top half of the
screen just makes sense. This glanceable info makes the screen so much more
useful, while still feeling quite 'Apple'. 
 
     I’ve been thinking about this too. they should let any app include a widget mode that can be any arbitrary
    size that fits into the icon grid. let the developers figure out what size or sizes makes sense for their
    app, and give the user an easy way to resize to expand the icon into the widget size they like, or just
    keep the icon. 4×4 makes sense, but could be bigger, or even smaller if the app content allows it, like
    maybe a ticker that scrolls info in a 2×1 size.



 I'd rather have some small watch-like complications under the date on the lock
screen than be able to replace home screen icons with them. But, I'm all in
favor of customization if we can have both. Unfortunately Apple is not big on
customization so we'll probably get neither. 
 
     so like this [https://repo.packix.com/package/com.bengiannis.complications/](https://repo.packix.com/packa
    ge/com.bengiannis.complications/)

     I was thinking the same thing - complications on the lock screen (notifications, weather, etc) and then 4x
    small widgets on the homescreen that take you to the app when tapped. I imagine selecting these by going
    into 'wiggle' mode and dragging whichever app you want up to the area, just like relocating apps. Those
    that are not yet optimised or compatible will just fall to the first line below.

     I like both!



 One of the few things I still miss about Android phones.  Android has had on
screen widgets for 10+ years.  I'm sure IOS will get there by IOS 15. 
 
     And yet no one ever uses them.  Pick any android phone and marketing never shows widgets.

     One of my overriding memories of Android was the home screen crashing.

     I’d love some customisation on the home screen but I doubt they would allow it. Everything should look the
    same to them.   I used to have a 3x4 row of icons on my old android phone in the centre near the bottom of
    the screen, easiest place to reach. Then I had some icons with swipe up to open a folder, or swipe up to
    open a different app. It was great.

     Apple has always been productivity oriented in everything they make, so I think the idea of having a wall
    paper only screen seems very unproductive to a user, cause whatever app you want to open you have to make
    a minimum of 1 extra gesture. I hope they never bring this. Also the way I see it, apple’s target crowd is
    a productive audience, and productive people don’t want to spend time customising their phone. It’s gotta
    work right just off the box. I would love to hear your thoughts on that.

     This actually makes sense, and seems like an Apple implementation

     Ooh I like this a lot. Looks like a great way to do it on the homescreen

     A lot of apps that have widgets implement it as available with force/long touch. Try Weather for example.
    You get a widget and a bunch of shortcuts.



 Ios users: „i Wish i could show widget on main screen” Also iOS users: “I have
never used widget screen in my life”  Problem with developing something
customizable is that you have to support it later and it is painful. Because It
have to work, looks good with future updates.   Maybe I am a little biased
because to be honest I have never seen anyone used widgets on their phone. Not
only iOS but android too. 
 
     I use widgets exclusively. My homescreen is completely empty. I realize that’s rare though.

     I think you're missing the point here: Widgets got their completely own page and it doesn't makes sense
    putting them there. e.g. you have the weather widget sitting there and the app on your first HS page. It
    will take you one tap on the HS to get the weather.   Or you have to swipe left to see the widget. Anyhow,
    it takes one action to find weather info. The same goes for agenda: most users have it on their first HS
    page so just opening the app gives you more info than just swiping to the Widget page.   Just giving users
    the option to place at least a widget on their HS would be great, It would give you essential info at
    glance.



 Coming from Android, the biggest thing I miss is not having an app drawer. Or at
least being able to have a blank screen with all apps on the other page. As well

It’s time to tell Apple to REDUCE the EXCESSIVE PADDING in iOS 26,"It’s time to tell Apple to REDUCE the EXCESSIVE PADDING in iOS 26

Seriously. I don’t have anything against iOS 26. It’s a great OS and a nice
change of UI since the last 9 years when iOS had a soft overhaul with the UI
starting with iOS 10 from 2016.  But the only thing that’s ticking me off is the
excessive padding and wasted space in iOS 26. It’s awful and looks like I turned
on Display Zoom with the font moved to 1 pt higher than the default. The worst
part is if you turn the font scaling to the smallest possible, you get an awful
spaced out UI with tiny fonts. In previous versions of iOS, the UI would scale a
bit smaller to accommodate for the smaller fonts. In iOS 26, the UI remains
locked at the default size even if you scale the fonts down to the smallest
setting.  Now I have an iPhone 11 Pro I test out at work that’s running iOS 26
and compared to the iPhone X running iOS 16, it’s a night and day difference
with how much you can see and view on iOS 16 versus iOS 26 where’s there’s so
much spacing and border padding in UI elements for some apps, you think your
phone screen is too small and cramped.  This video here greatly articulates on
this issue. The person here speaks about the iPhone 13 Mini in how the screen is
cramped with iOS 26, but this applies for the iPhone 11 Pro, the 6.1 inch iPhone
12 to 16 as well. It’s only when you get to the 6.3 inch iPhone, the UI in iOS
26 looks properly spaced (but still too big).  Video:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NF0Zp-Rd43A  Please send Apple feedback about this
and tell them to reduce the border padding. It’s excessive and wastes valuable
screen space!  Feedback Form: https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone/

 Yeah I hate all that extra padding and big UI elements. I'm hopeful this gets
refined in updates.

     BenchPebble said: >It’s never been an issue before on my 15 pro, but now I can’t unsee it  I didn’t notice
    it much until I saw the Settings and the Notes app. There was a lot more scrolling than usual too lol. The
    whole point of getting a bigger 6.1 inch iPhone was that you would see more information than on your
    smaller 4.7 inch iPhone, but now iOS 26 has so much wasted space that even iOS 12 on the 4.7 inch iPhone 6
    has more stuff to display than on a larger iPhone.   It’s not a good UI design if everything looks bloated
    up. That’s why Display Zoom exists in the first place. Speaking of that, Display Zoom just breaks
    everything if you enable it. The UI is so blown up that the UI elements just cut right into each other.
    Rip to the folks with impaired vision, lol.



 We are all designers now

Will apple ever fix the unresponsive screen issue from IOS 26 in future updates?,"Will apple ever fix the unresponsive screen issue from IOS 26 in future updates?

more than a month ago, i made a post about my iphone 11's touchscreen being
unresponsive after my phone automatically installed the IOS 26 update. my phone
wouldn't respond to any touches (not even sliding to unlock the phone itself)
but it would wake when i tap it and i can manually navigate the screen using the
VoiceOver feature (a very tiring and unsustainable process) — therefore, i
conclude it's not a hardware issue but an update incompatibility. (link to old
post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/s/9MtuXuAZZ3).  i managed to upgrade to IOS
26.1 in hopes of this issue or bug being fixed.   good news: i got the
touchscreen working again!  bad news: after more than 150 HARD RESETS (not
joking, it took a lot of time and patience).  another bad news: i shut my phone
down to test if the issue is now permanently resolved. it's NOT. so i had to do
150 MORE hard resets and now it's working again so now i got to make sure the
phone NEVER shuts down.  i only see a number of people experiencing the same
issue and i'm afraid it's not enough for apple to actually do something about it
even if i sent out numerous reports about it already to apple. i'm kinda bummed
out because IOS 26 is the last major update iphone 11 is getting and it's so
clunky and constantly hard resetting my phone just isn't a very sustainable way
to use a device and i can't really afford to replace it, but what are the
chances it actually gets resolved?

 My iPad Pro M1 12.9” is completely bricked from unresponsive touchscreen after
installing 26.1. Have tried several hard resets and several Update/Restores from
my MacBook. Nothing will fix it. I’m so upset and disappointed in Apple 
 
     sorry to hear that, man. i hope you find a solution and let me know when you do

iOS 26 update is ruining screen time!!,"iOS 26 update is ruining screen time!!

Hi, I’m 17 and have screen time on my Apple devices and I’ve had no problem with
it all these years until I updated to this STUPID NEW IOS 26 UPDATE!!! Like
honestly the only reason I did it was cause it seemed cool and honestly it was
until I saw what it did to my screen time. Ok for context with screen time for
me, I have everything locked at 9:00 pm besides google, chrome and a few other
apps and I liked it like that, and I also have no content and privacy
restrictions at all, keep that in mind. So why is it that once my screen time
hit, the moment I tried to search up anything, or click on any website, it hit
me with screen time???? And I had both apps unlocked indefinitely?? And that’s
not even the worse part. On non web browser apps I had unlocked, when they had
ads or anything with a web browser, it wouldn’t automatically be blocked as well
even though, like I said, I had them unlocked?? So I’m honestly so confused and
frustrated and feel dumb for trying out this new update early, and it’s honestly
disappointing cause I really like some of the new features of this update and I
really hope they fix it soon, cause if I see no changes I’m downgrading back to
18.

 Unfortunately you can’t downgrade to 18 anymore. 
 
     Crap🤦‍♀️I’m really regretting updating now…



 Cold comfort but my 13 mini (Australia) currently running on 18.5 is showing
18.7 and 26 available for download. 
 
     😭that’s exactly what I saw before I updated and instead of simply choosing 18.7 I decided to rush all the
    way to 26🤦‍♀️



 Restraint and patience. Good thing I chose to stay with 18.7 
 


 So you’re upset the screen time got fixed on iOS 26? 
 
     And the new 1 minute screen time got worse as well🤦‍♀️

     It didn’t get “fixed” it’s literally broken dude🙄 like I have google and chrome unlocked yet they’re still
    blocked like what don’t you understand😐

IPads with Screen time activated keep prompting Apple ID Login,"IPads with Screen time activated keep prompting Apple ID Login

Maybe I've more luck in this sub. I hope someone can help. (Text of the
crosspost copy pasted below again)   I have a few iPads which are always
limited/locked with the screen time feature because children are using them.
Lately I've got issues with an apple ID Login prompting every time after the
devices stay in locked mode for a few hours. It doesn't matter if you cancel it
or insert the correct apple ID password, the prompt shows up again 5 seconds
later. This will happen until you either exit the screen time mode, or restart
the IPad.   I've seen this issue on 20 IPads, all with IOS 26 installed. I
already tried disabling ICloud backup because I thought this might trigger the
issue, with no improvement. The only workaround right now is to shut them off
totally until someone uses it again, or to disable screen time permanently.   I
know that there are MDM Solutions to solve this, but I won't be able to get it
done this year. There must be any other solution to fix this for now. At least I
hope so.   If needed I can check on the exact model of the iPads as well. But I
think it must be connected to anything locked in screen time which triggers it.
But I don't know what exactly.   Thanks in advance!"

 Or at least be able to reorder the pages 
 
     Yes! Being unable to reorder pages drives me crazy. (edit: typo)

     God, yes. I was disappointed when I discovered that I could look at all of my pages and enable/disable
    them but not drag and drop them and reorder them.

     This, so much this.   I’ve got three pages and I want to swap page 2 and 3 and was shocked that I
    couldn’t, just seems like an obvious addition.

     Was this a thing at the beginning of iOS 14 betas? I would have sworn it was, and then I went to rearrange
    pages the other day and discovered I couldn’t do it. And now I feel like I’m taking crazy pills because I
    was so certain it was possible. Absolutely needs to be a feature added ASAP.

     Haha I only have one Home Screen page so 😅



 There’s iOS 15. 
 


 There was an option in one of the earlier betas to automatically change your
Home Screen background through Shortcuts. I think it got pulled because there
wasn’t a limitation on the file type that could be used and it could break the
springboard. That could be coming back after it’s been fleshed out a bit, but
changing the whole Home Screen layout would be an even bigger improvement. 
 


 You can use widgetsmith to change your home screen dynamically during the day.

 This happens in Safari too when you visit a website recognised as an app, such
as Reddit. 
 


 That’s actually really cool 
 


 Also, the screen time utility will restrict you from opening any site in safari
too that has an app. For example, if you put a time limit on Facebook or
Instagram, it will not let you open them in Safari after your time limit has
reached. 
 


 It’s a webapp.  Webapps that you can install a shortcut on your home screen
generally can be registered as a separate entry in screen time. Gmail is another
example. 
 


 Creepy... they can tell who you’re contacting over Twitter? 
 
     [deleted]

     Here’s how I think it works (a guess): iOS can see the website associated with a Twitter account. (You can
    put a link to your website in your Twitter bio.) iOS pulls websites from Safari to do a similar thing:
    spend some time on Reddit.com in Safari, and screen time will show it as time using the Reddit app.

     This seems so invasive... I thought Apple values your privacy? Why do they do this?!  I have been getting
    a lot of downvotes so I want to understand from those who downvoted why you want to allow Apple access to
    your private information? Apple claims that they have one of the best privacy policies. This is from
    someone that has just recently switched to iOS because I wanted to trust that Apple has better privacy

     I learned that just right now

     moving cursor was always so cumbersome so I memorised this as soon as I heard it.  if you need to move the
    cursor down, there is not much room below the space bar to move the cursor, but if you press and hold
    space bar until the moving activates then lift your finger you have about half a second to put your finger
    back down before the action stops to let you reposition and allow moving down.

     The empty space below on non home button devices works too. Also, tap with a second finger to go into
    selection mode.

     Been like that for a while! You can also just drag the cursor (new in I think iOS 13). Also on iPad you
    can hold any key with 2 fingers.



 There are some things that Apple as a company do so well and this is one of the
example. Other stuff? Man sheesh. The exact opposite. 
 


 This is actually very cool tbh. 
 


 Not the twitter app right? 
 


 Did you try restarting?

ScreenTime is very useful. However, there is one thing I can't figure out how to

to be able to use other random apps on iOS while listening to music at say,

9pm, without having the distractions of other apps available?  The music is on
Apple Music. Family subscription. She often uses headphones.  I'm thinking about
a Home Pod... Would that help? HomePod wouldn't be affected by the ScreenTime,
right? And they could Bluetooth it to headphones... right? And stream all of our
Apple Music... I assume?  Thanks for any tips! Going analog is not an option.
Some sort of simple device that could steam from Apple Music would be an option
but I have no idea what that could be.

 HomePod’s a good idea. It plays Apple Music without screen time limits, but it
only works with airpods or airplay, not bluetooth

 Hi all,  I’m building an iOS app for personal use that would need to use some
of Apple’s “Screen Time” / Family Controls–style APIs (things like device
activity monitoring or blocking apps).  I know you can normally sideload your
own apps with a free Apple ID using Xcode, but I’m confused about whether these
privacy-sensitive entitlements (Screen Time, Family Controls, device activity)
can be enabled without a paid developer account.  For example:         •
Can I run and test my own app on my personal iPhone with these entitlements
while signed in with a free Apple ID?         •       Or does Apple require a
full $99/year Developer Program membership to even sign the app with those
capabilities?         •       Are there any special requests or approval
processes I’d have to go through for these APIs?  Any developers who have
actually tried this — how did you set it up?  Thanks!"

    for your iCloud. I’ve tried changing it but once I close the settings it goes back to the darn letter

     Only bug I have right now is the notification tone is rebound even when I have note (default) picked. I’m
    on iPhone 13 Pro Max. It’s annoying.

     I'm unable to get the auto sorting groceries feature in Reminders. It just doesn't work for me.

     I just created a new contact and I'm not able to set one of the custom text alert tones that I had
    created. The only alert tones available are the built-in ones.  That's got to be a bug.

     A bug in Safari: When swiping between different folders on tabs, it clearly stutters.

     Same bug as in IOS 16.X versions, the notification lagging is still there.

     Well the status bar doesn’t appear on some apps

     Standby mode is a bug. It’s just blank widgets. Good work Apple. Very useful.

     I already found something (I think), ‘siri’ doesn’t work with my airpods, I have to say ‘hey siri’. Small
    annoyance I know

     Amazon app is having a stroke, on my 14 pro and my brother's 14 pro max. When I go into orders, face id
    scans my face about 10 times and then it says no orders. It also won't let me change country, it's stuck
    on usa even though I'm in germany. App works fine on android and I literally used it before the update to
    ios 17, it worked just fine. Tried cropping an image once and the ""done"" and ""cancel"" button were behind
    the status bar, so I couldn't press them and had to force close. Trying to change my contact pic doesn't
    work. I'm sure I'll find more but this is already ridiculous imo

     Live Background won’t work. Even with new Live Photos 🥲

     My screenshot are bad in quality for some reason, ever since i updated

     No bugs to report

     Bug or maybe feature removal, the ability to slide a finger to scrub thought videos is gone. If I knew
    this was going to happen I wouldn’t have downloaded the update…



 Won’t let me install. I’m on Wi-Fi and plugged into power. Rocking a 12 pro max
with plenty of storage 
 
     Delete and redownload the update file

     You aren’t “rocking” anything.



 This iOS 17 kinda made my phone snappier lmao  EDIT: I am on iPhone 13 Pro Max.
What I noticed is that the animation and transition scale were changed like how
you can do it on an Android device with the Developer Options 
 
     Same

     I thought I was the only one. For some reason this and the Apple Watch update feel smoother and more
    responsive. I like it!

     Way smoother then IOS 16

     Yeah it feels much smoother than iOS 16

     People always say that after a new iOS

     Same here

     sadly on my iPhone 11 Pro it’s a bit slower than iOS 16. My battery capacity is at 76% 😁.

     can anyone confirm this on XR?

     My 14 Pro also has a fresh spring scent now...

     It’s because updating forced your phone to clear caches. You probably never do this. I see no difference.

     what iphone?

     I noticed the same thing.   It also made Face ID much faster than before.

     Omfg samesies. I have a 13 Pro and thought that same exact thing.

     I noticed this too on my 13 Pro.   Wasn’t sure if I was just imagining it, but seems to be many people
    reporting everything being more responsive.

     Question how has the battery life been effected so far  Did you notice a decrease



 Hold on to your butts:  * Safari feels snappier * My battery life is worse *
Some bullshit - is this normal? * My phone/ipad/laptop is stuck updating for
hours now * My phone is getting hot * Help! I can't update * I miss iOS 16. It
was better * Where did some bullshit go? * Does this icon look crooked to you? *
Is this a half-dead pixel in this spot that no one would ever notice except
someone with mental illness? * My airpods/keyboard/mouse/other bullshit will no
longer connect * Some app will no longer work * My special device that is
medical which has warnings will not work on a new OS is no longer working
because I ignored every warning popup and email and upgraded anyway * How do I
go back to iOS 7? * I can't get this to work on an iPhone 3GS! Apple sucks! *
Help! I tried to load iPad OS on an Intel PC and now it is broken! * Carplay no
longer recognizes my phone * Where did all of my files go? * Is it just me, or
does the screen have a slight hue change that there is no way that someone
without superpowers could possibly see * I dropped my iphone (picture with
massive damage) - do you think I can upgrade to iOS 17? * Notification that iOS
17.1 has entered public beta 
 
     I am dead lmao but accurate.

     > My battery life is worse  You forgot:      ""My battery life is better""

     If it aint broke, why break it?(upgrade)

     Should be a bingo lol

     HaHa this reminds me of the time many years ago when I had bought my very first iPhone - the first time I
    updated it I was so frustrated with the changes I literally threw the phone at the wall.  The second time
    there was an update, I took the phone back to the store…



 First thing I noticed was how snappier it seemed switching between apps and Home
Screen. 
 
     I noticed that, too! My XR feels fast again

     Wtf is snappier?

iOS 18.5 - screen time / privacy setting - need help,"iOS 18.5 - screen time / privacy setting - need help

Hi guys,I have a really frustrating problem with my Iphone (iOS - 18.5).I have
activated Screen Time -> Restrictions in the settings to customize a few apps
and settings in a privacy-friendly way. For some time now (unfortunately I can't
define an exact time) two points can no longer be changed. To be precise, the
settings under Photos and Calendar cannot be changed and are always set to
“allow” no matter what you select under the options. I hope you can understand
what I am trying to describe :)I have not enabled iCloud or Family Sharing.The
location & privacy settings have already been completely reset once. I also did
a full backup with my MacBook and restored it on the newly installed device -
neither solution.I'm really not a beginner with Apple but this problem is really
perplexing me and I look forward to any solutions.

 [removed] 
 
     Thank you very much for your solution, which I immediately tried out. Unfortunately it did not work. No
    matter what option I select under Photos and Calendar - it always remains at “Allow” All other items such
    as microphone or contacts can be changed without any problems.



 Is this resolved? Same bug for my Photos and Calendar. 
 
     No, not yet - did you find a solution for this?



 the bug is still here as of ios 18.6. still not fixed.

Apple can make me switch faster by not fixing Siri and swipe-type once and for all

It's mostly a vent, but I needed to say it. I've been super impressed by some of
the AI features on Galaxy S24 Ultra and for the first time in years I missed
Android. I don't think it's fair to pay a decent amount for a modern iPhone
while the main voice assistant is Siri (and you can't change it), there are only
few AI features in the Photos app (but no object deletion, or the feature that
lets you move an object while the AI re-generates its empty space, etc.). I want
multi-turn interactions with Siri. I want Siri to remember what I said before as
opposed to starting from fresh each time. I want my iPhone to be smart enough to
""read"" what's on the screen and show relevant suggestions when I'm texting or
typing. I want generative AI features like Samsung has to create wallpapers on
the go based on my prompt. I know iPhone's hardware is capable of running local
large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and I will be utterly
disappointed if Apple doesn't do anything about these cool AI technologies in
iOS 18.

 i understand the need for siri improvements but honestly i hate the integration
some phones are doing with ai. just feels invasive, with how much processing is
being offloaded to the cloud. 
 
     Galaxy S24 does some of those stuff locally on the device thanks to its neural cores.



 Who cares about AI marketing???? 
 
     Most people are still very much on the hype train. I think most of what we’ll see will be gimmicks, but
    allow Apple to check a box saying “we do AI too”.



 I switched from the iPhone 14 to the S24, and I'd say that while some of the AI
features might be gimmicks, others are genuinely useful, like photo editing,
content summarization, and live translation.  I really hope Apple delivers a
similar product later this year, or next year if necessary. Apple's track record
made me believe that they could create a superior user experience for this type
of product. 
 


 Cool story, bro. 
 


 “If iOS 18 doesn’t introduce a bunch of [colossally
overhyped](https://youtu.be/xbf4BGIBENk?feature=shared) and often flat-out wrong
internet research tools built entirely on stolen content that hurts the actual
creators behind it, run without any regards for my privacy or their harm to
society overall, I’m switching to Android.”  Cool story bro. See ya 
 


 You realize that AI has actually been around for years, working in manufacturing
plants, etc., don’t you?  And what they’re calling AI now is just the latest
version/trend? 
 
     Yes, but the generative AI didn't use to be like this, and Apple is falling behind very fast in this space



 I have the same feeling lately, as iPhone is starting to stagnate in innovation
while the competitors are at the same level or even surpassing it in some areas.
I recently got a Oneplus 12r for $400 as an international travel phone with dual
sims because my 14 pro max is esim only and so far I can’t tell the difference
in my daily usage. It’s disappointing when you see end users go out of their way
to defend the iPhone for its shortcomings… 
 
     They don't have to be the top trailblazers for innovation, but there are admittedly some basic features
    iPhones don't have that do kinda bug me. Not being able to put apps wherever you want on the homescreen,
    adjustable camera controls, an app drawer instead of the god awful app library shit, split screen apps, or
    even forcing a universal back gesture are all basic things I feel like iOS would have sorted out by now,
    but they haven't. I know they're probably intentionally witholding features in order to gradually roll
    them out to keep their stock values rising over time, but goddamn that shit sucks.  I couldn't care less
    about AI features, at least in their current state, on smartphones.



 Hope they don’t dare putting that shit on my perfectly functioning phone. I use
Siri to turn the lights on and off and to start phone calls, and that’s about
all I need. These gimmicks, while they might be technically impressive, are just
that, gimmicks, they wouldn’t substantially change the usability of the phone
for the better. And generative AI is doing enough damages now that it’s in a
very small % of phones, don’t put it in the most popular phone so that every
idiot can start creating fake images 
 


 Ai sucks, I can tell they definitely changed something in the way recommended
words come out. I have the option turned off but it still changes my words to
something that makes absolutely no sense in the sentence im texting. Before the
last 2 patches, it would perfectly predict what I was trying to text, but now
it’s like someone just kept hitting it with a hammer and it’s almost braindead
now. I guarantee that Ai is why it’s doing this now. 
 


 The AI features on the s24U r google AI features not Samsungs 
 
     Not true, they use google AI for some features but the introduced features in their own app like phone
    call transcript and reply with text and a bunch of other in the other Samsung apps

Having more screen time than I know I had?,"Having more screen time than I know I had?

I have screen time limits on my phone but I know the passcode. I am not overly
using the code, but odd stuff has happened today. For starters, I have a
1hr45min limit on instagram daily, and I had only been active on it for about
45min-1hr max, when suddenly, while I was using another app, I got the
notification that I only had 5min remaining on Instagram for the day. I checked
my screen time and in that moment, it showed the correct screen time. I just
thought it was a glitch, but then, when I exited the app I had been using, I
noticed the Instagram Icon indicated I was out of time, so I checked my screen
time history (note: I had not opened Instagram between these two times) and
suddenly I was at 1hr,45min. I do have an ipad connected to my apple id, but all
screen time tracking is off, so they are both linked. Also, the Ipad had not
been used since last night. I also noticed I had 45min on something called
ScreenTimeUnlock, which when I look it up, appears to be a screen time bypass
app. I do not have this app. What is going on with my phone?

 I have this issue too, I have 1 hr limits on YouTube and Instagram, but after
using it for 30 min and then using a different app, when I come back they are
greyed out and it shows 1h+ of screen time that I didn’t actually use. 
 


 Screen time is an awful feature that hasn’t been touched nor fixed since it was
introduced. It shows random numbers for the actual screen time and the daily
limits sometimes work and sometimes don’t.   I tried using it for weeks, ended
up turning it off. I recommend doing the same. 
 
     I wish I could turn it off, but my parents would not allow it if they found out. Thank you for your advice
    though!

Apple should experiment with clear icons that retain individual glyph/logo colors,"Apple should experiment with clear icons that retain individual glyph/logo colors

I’ve been messing with the new icon customization options and thought it could
look really cool if the new Liquid Glass icons could retain their individual
colors. Currently the Clear icons are all the same color which hinders
recognition time when trying to find a specific app, and removes individual
colors which a big part of brand design. If Apple tested Colored Clear app
icons, this could potentially make recognition and accessibility better while
still allowing a more widespread application of Liquid Glass on the home screen.
I made a couple very* rough drafts to try and communicate my idea. I’d like to
see them test this in at least one Dev beta so we can see if this would work
well or if it would create its own accessibility issues.   What are your
thoughts?

 Looks awesome! I’m surprised they didn’t offer this as an option over the all
glass style tbh 
 
     It is a better idea then the all glass option, but I guess they can fake the all glass look easier without
    devs updating the icons. I feel for this idea to work it really requires devs to update their icons.
    However next year they might be able to see how many icons have been updated and maybe do it then.

     It’s probably a deliberate reason. Do you think the didn’t think of this? I just wonder why? Maybe they
    are saving it for next year?

     iOS 27!

     [removed]



 This is what I expected icons to look like by default in the reveal. Kind of
disappointed this look wasn’t included at all. Glad you’re bringing it up. Maybe
they’ll add it before release. 
 


 the problem is a lot of companies don't have icons that are just the logo, and i
think that's what's stopping apple from doing this - the possibility of there
being a visual ""mix"" of icons on our screens 
 
     I feel like they could test this with the default apps first, and then explore options for other 3rd party
    apps with more complex icons.   Imho, the current approach of just throwing an app with a regular image
    icon into grayscale and calling it good feels really lazy and looks horrendous. there has to be a better
    approach for that

     True, the default could just be the single color glass. If companies then want to design something custom
    they could

     This seems like something that (ideally) AI could handle if the developer doesn’t create an optimized
    icon. Something like having the hue/saturation determine the transparency of the glass

     I did a quick glance at my home screen and most of the apps have a distinct main icon glyph, so this
    should be doable for almost all of the apps.



 Tried posting about this a week ago and mods wouldn’t allow it.  ChatGPT mockup:

     Yes, this is exactly how I thought clear would look. It makes the most sense, since it's much clearer what
    each app is.

     Perfect! This is what the iOS 26 liquid glass icons SHOULD look like. It blows my mind that Apple thought
    indistinguishable colorless icons was the way to go. Insane how braindead and clueless this company can
    be. It should have been glaringly obvious that transparent icons still need color. Zero common sense.

     it doesn't look good imo

 See ya in iOS 27. 
 


 Literally every mock up on ideas for iOS26 has looked better than the actual
beta 
 


 dang maybe i’m not the first one to think of this lol 
 
     I feel like this was the most common sense approach. The all-glass style is just terrible, everything
    looks exactly the same, how that got approved is beyond me



 I didn’t even think of this, but this looks wayyyy better than the clear mode
apple is offering now, I hope more people sending suggestions to apple about
this, so they might give it a try 
 
     I put in my own feedback ticket with a little blurb about accessibility and these pics, not sure if
    they’ll reply or how many other people have also had this idea, but we shall see!



 You mean… have the part that doesn’t signify any important information be
transparent and have the part that does be visible… you’re making too much
sense!   From an objective point of view, MacOS and iOS 26 icons are bad. Not
because of aesthetics but because they’re too difficult to read. Catalina was
the last version of MacOS where icons were allowed to have unique sillhouettes
instead of fiting into the same shape. MacOS 26 icons are not able to use
materials other than liquid glass, and have to be designed so that they’re still
visible without any range of colour while being transparent.

Screen Time bypass on iOS 18.3.2 using custom boot sequence (iPhone 11),"Screen Time bypass on iOS 18.3.2 using custom boot sequence (iPhone 11)

I discovered what seems to be a new Screen Time bypass bug on **iOS 18.3.2**
using a slightly unusual boot method. I haven’t found any existing mentions of
this, so I’m posting here to see if others can reproduce it and confirm.  # 📱
Device & OS:  * **Device**: iPhone 11 * **iOS**: 18.3.2 (latest version at the
time of posting)  # 🔓 The bug:  Using a specific boot sequence, Screen Time
restrictions **don’t activate at all** — **until** a Screen Time-related event
happens (e.g. Downtime starts, a new limit begins, or you manually open Screen
Time settings).  During this period:  * **All apps, including restricted ones,
are accessible** * **There’s no daily limit enforcement** * **Downtime doesn’t
apply**  # 🔁 How to reproduce:  1. Press and release **Volume Up** 2. Press and
release **Volume Down** 3. Hold the **Side (Power) button** until the Apple logo
appears 4. **Release** the button for \~4 seconds 5. Then **press and hold the
Side button again** until the phone fully boots  💡 I originally discovered this
during class — my daily limits had already expired, and I wanted to access
Discord. I tried the old reboot-based delay trick but accidentally **pressed the
phone against the table, holding the Power button** at a random moment during
boot. That’s when I noticed Screen Time didn’t re-enable after booting.  # ⏱
Duration:  The bypass lasts **indefinitely**, **until**:  * A new Screen Time
event triggers (e.g. Downtime starts) * Or you reboot again normally  # 🔀 Two
types of behavior:  Upon repeated testing, I noticed **two types of behavior**
after triggering the bug:  # Type 1 — Fully working bypass:  * All apps work
fine * No Screen Time restrictions * Everything behaves normally  # Type 2 —
Bypass with media issues:  * **Apps like TikTok load very slowly** * **No
sound** in most media apps (especially those with built-in video players) *
**Camera app is partially broken** — blurs/flickers every \~2 seconds *
Otherwise, the system is stable  Both types result in a Screen Time bypass. Type
2 has odd media behavior but doesn’t crash or reboot the phone.  # ⚠️ No
jailbreak, no tricks:  * No jailbreaking or external tools * Stock iOS * Tested
only on iPhone 11 so far  # 🧪 Can anyone reproduce?  If you have:  * Screen Time
enabled * iOS 18.3.2 or close  Try it and let me know what type you get.

 Had a customer come in with his daughter because she found a bypass. She
FaceTimed someone who did not have screen time restrictions, and then allowed
that person to remotely control her (restricted) phone. Completely removed all
the restrictions as well as the screen time passcode. 
 
     Thanks for sharing that — sounds like a clever trick!   However, if the parent properly set up Screen Time
    through **Family Sharing** in their Apple ID account, this bypass wouldn't work.

iOS 17 has finally killed Screen Time for my family,"iOS 17 has finally killed Screen Time for my family

After two days of fighting it, we’re done. 16 made the stupid change to having
Screen Time notifications come in via text messages, but you could fix that by
choosing to not receive messages at your Apple ID and only using your phone
number. Well, they nixed that as of 17.   Now Scree Time notifications ONLY
deliver via text message, using only your Apple ID. If you remove those, the
requests just don’t send.   I don’t know what genius came up with this, but man,
it sucks. Screen Time is as already an iffy experience anyway, but it was used
with success in our family. Anyone got a better suggestion? Maybe another app to
help with this?

 The bigger issue I have is the app limits keep resetting. 
 
     Has anyone found a fix for this?  Seems to reset almost daily and deletes all the limits I have in.  No,
    my kid does not have the passcode. Makes it worthless other than downtime.

     same



 Can’t believe they really did this. I just don’t understand how they are sitting
there, reviewing this feature and saying, yes, thats what users want, its so
much better than push messages. And on top of making the handling of such
requests less convenient it kills the integration with the apple watch because
you can’t answer the requests on the apple watch anymore but need to open the
message on an ios device. Absolutely fabulous decision. 
 
     it actually kinda sucked the old way.  atleast text messages open up instantly  you could get the
    notification the old way and if you tapped it, instead of holding it, youd have to wait like a minute for
    the stupid settings to finally load



 [This article](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-parental-controls-
iph00ba7d632/ios) seems to indicate you can view the requests and notifications
in Settings > Screen Time as well as through Messages: I’m assuming this means
you can turn message-based notifications off and still access the requests
through Settings, but I think this is something to bring up with Apple Support. 
 


 Is this still not fixed ? My kids keep telling me they’re sending requests, but
I never get them :( 
 
     Same thing here. I can’t figure out how to fix it either.



 I can’t even get downtime to work anymore!!  Can’t access my kids phone from
mine.  Majorly pissed off 
 


 I have a similar but more annoying (to me) problem... Both of my kids' iPhones
have been updated to iOS 17. My daughter's screen time requests still come the
normal way (as a push notification) but my son's come as BOTH a push
notification and a text message. The message is sent to my wife and me but she
never sees them as her Apple ID is not set to receive messages. She doesn't get
the push notifications anymore either. There's got to be a fix to this. I didn't
start receiving messages until after the iOS 17 update.  EDIT: I set my account
to only receive messages to my phone number. Now I don’t get the text OR push
notifications for my son any longer. Just great. 
 
     Same here. Had to be someone at Apple without children who came up with this change. Really annoying they
    don’t give an option to turn this off.



 What about the settings just resetting every day? The downtime schedules I make,
the content restrictions, the ability to turn off their access to change account

kids is just reset. Everything is just wiped out like we never set anything.
This has been going on for months for some people. I call Apple and they’re
useless. Thousands have complained on forums and there’s still no fix.

    different strategy. Thinking of buying the AT&T app.



 I have the opposite problem. I like the update when the request is on Messages.
But since last week, the prompt sends me to Settings! How do I reverse this? I
like the Messages better

 Such a love hate relationship with this. When it works, it’s a great utility,
but it’s so frustrating when it doesn’t and it usually took a few tries before
it recognized what I was trying to do.   I don’t have an advice to offer sadly,
but I feel your pain.

How to prevent getting more time when screen time limits run out,"How to prevent getting more time when screen time limits run out

I’m trying to limit my social media usage, but even having set screentime limits
for these apps I can literally just click “give me 15 more minutes” infinitely.
I looked it up, but I see no option to “block at end of limit” in the limit
settings for each app. What the hell is the point of a limit if you can
infinitely extend it.  Actually baffling that apple makes it this unintuitive to
add these limits."

So I've read up a lot on screen time but it hasn't helped, when I set up
restrictions in screen time I can just...still change those settings without a

everyone will use one pin, it's linked to an apple id that I created solely for
this purpose   My ideal situation is that there's exactly two things allowed on
this: access Google Chrome browser, and access camera. That's it.  I've gotta
just be dense here and not getting something, looking for guidance as it's a bit

I am not sure what subreddit to ask, but my girlfriend took my phone while we
were driving. She was really sneaky about it but gave it back while laughing. I
asked her what she did and she will not tell me. Got it back and it was opened
in the Settings app with “con” searched up. IIRC i glanced over at her, and she
was doing something with a bunch of toggles that were all toggled on. Screenshot
is where she was when I opened my phone. On iOS 17.2.1 if that matters.

     this is reddit, anything relationship related will always get “break up” as a solution

 An innocent possibility is that she changed a contact name(s) in your phone. 
 
     I think it could be this. Accidentally searched in settings.



 Maybe she’s just pulling a CON on you? 
 


 Probably she set a time limit for specific apps I guess 
 
     Parental settings on and blocked adult content. You shouldn’t need that anyway now right op?



 Check out ""Content & Privacy Restrictions"" and ""Communication Limits"" 
 
     I second this. I’d bet she made changes to some of the apps that he spends all of his time on. Restricting
    time limits or something.  The other possibility would be Control Center changes but that doesn’t fit the
    pranking giggle.  >Searched Con  >Hitting toggles  More than likely she changed app restrictions in
    Content & Privacy settings to mess with OP

Hi, So I am making this post because I am not sure what to do and a little
worried that this means the person using the phone reset everything and has now
gained access to all of the intentionally locked features. tldr; we have a very
mentally sick person living with us so they are only allowed to access certain
things, I went in the settings and blocked all ip id editing permissions and
every option I saw I turned off so that they could only text and call the family
thats it. Somehow this morning I received the email and now Im worried that they
can now access everything.     Anyone know of what the best way to block
everything would be moving forward?

 You have to give more info about exactly how you have this set up - is it your
AppleID? Did you make one for this person? Screenshot the email or copy and
paste the text without showing the address. 
 
     Okay so I have a seperate apple ID that I made for my work phone, its like name.work@gmail.comm. This ID
    has two recovery phone numbers as well as the gmail. The Recovery phone numbers are my main phone # and
    the phone number for this work phone, the gmail is only accessible via my PC.   The issue I am facing is
    that I received a email a hour or so ago that the apple ID associated with my workphone has been
    successfully reset, I also went to apples site to try and login on my pc and it says wrong password;   htt

    2f00526  So I was able to get the phone and in the settings on the top it says something about ""Ready to
    setup your new phone"" and thats about it. I have the screen time restrictions still active so the account
    info on the top of the settings app cant be opened as its greyed out, I tried disabling some of the screen
    time settings to access it but couldnt find which one directly toggles that and didnt have much timeso
    decided to reset the password anyways. However I am stuck on resetting the password because for some
    reason none of the steps are working.



 Are you certain the email you received is legit? It's very likely it's a
phishing attempt to gain access to your account. 
 
     I was thinking that so thats why I went directly to apples website and am not following the links from the
    email. Regardless I am unable to reset my password so not sure what the deal is, It asks for my recovery
    phone number, I enter it then it asks for the code sent to the phone, then it asks for the password of the
    iphone that has the locked apple ID and once I enter the code it says ""Dont know your passcode?"" I did
    these steps on both my ipad and iphone using the apple support app.

    [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1b17fg0/i_have_been_asking_apple_weekly_for_almost_two/) post
    received over 800 upvotes in just a few days. It’s likely that many of those 800 redditors also sent
    feedback to Apple through their feedback page, resulting in a surge of specific requests for this feature.
    And guess what? They introduced it in iOS 18! While this feature may have already been in the works, we
    can’t ignore the possibility that our collective efforts played a role in making it happen.



 iOS has a user base of 1.4 billion, this sub doesn’t even have half a million
users... 
 
     How many of those 1.4b people submit bug reports?



 Don’t forget that seeing your calendar and reminders together is not new. We had
a widget for this before Apple took it away in iOS 14. 
 


 This is such an amazing feature. Other apps literally ask money for this. I’m
glad Apple hears and implements.

     yea I think the only ones who use it and care enough. the most common use case is probably parents, and it
    would be a win for the kid if the parent never found out this crap resets



 I am experiencing the same issue.

started happening AFTER I logged into my son’s iphone and he had different

keep getting his settings. 
 


 This has been happening to me for about a year, maybe two. Across the 6s and now
12 mini. I’m now on 16.1.1 and it just happened again. I’ll try the reset in
case it works now on iOS 16, not holding my breath!

Screen time restrictions are enabled but are not enough and can be bypassed? somehow apple id was reset?,"Screen time restrictions are enabled but are not enough and can be bypassed? somehow apple id was reset?

Apple support is working with me on this;     \-  This is important for anyone
who has to restrict a iphones content usage, I received a notification that the
apple id associated with the iphone being used by a person with restrictions was
reset. Every app and setting in that phone is restricted/locked from being used
via the screentime settings. Account settings cannot be accessed or anything
even a web browser. Somehow this person was able to access something that
allowed them to reset the password for the apple id. When I find the solution I
will update later but for now does anyone have any ideas? The recovery #s are
for the same phone and a different phone, the email is not accessible on this
phone nor is there any email app that they can access on this phone. There is no
recovery phone number text on either phone. Whatever happened had to have
happened via the settings app. Or they guessed the screen time passcode.  Apple
support is telling me now that they believe if a system wide notification was
sent out to enter a password for whatever reason such as to change it or
something that could cause it but since I have all restrictions turned on they
are not sure what could have caused a prompt like that. Im thinking that they
were able to go to settings and hit the reset button on the phone, not the erase
all content and settings but the other one and that this may have prompted them
to enter the password for my appleid which they can subsequently get wrong until
it prompts them to reset it. Regardless they decided to upgrade me to a senior
tech to try and find a solution.

 Won’t the person tell you what they did?

 You're going to be an incredible dad!

 One of the biggest reasons I deleted my socials from my phone!! I don't want my
future baby seeing me as just the mom that stares at her phone all the time! 
 
     I want to avoid that at all costs



 Good for you!!! Sometimes I think of a tragic moment when my son was 4 or 5 and
I was scrolling emails on my phone and he was trying to tell me something.
Suddenly he grabbed my hands and pulled them down so the phone wasn't in front
of my face. He begged me to put the phone down as he told me he was right there.
It broke my whole heart. From that moment on I tried to always put the phone
down and live our lives in the present together. Phones are addictive. It's
important we take our minds back, especially for our children. 
 
     You're right, especially to set an example



 After your child is born ask yourself everyday “did I look into my baby’s eyes
more than my smartphone today?” Have a blessed day. 
 
     That's the goal



 Not saying you should have a baby now, but having a powerful reason to change
makes a huge difference. It seems obvious, but it's true. 
 
     Hey man, having a kid was my most-hugest ""excuse""/reason for becoming a more present person. With anyone
    in my life.    I'm only (95%+ of the time 😂) on my phone when my baby is sleeping, and even when she's
    sleeping, it's so tempting to set the phone down and cherish all the little breaths and everything about
    the moment. So, well, that's what happens. You'll set that phone down, lol. You won't regret it! 😊



 Gang, keep it up.    When you get tired will be the real test  
 
     thanks!



 Are you using an app to track your screen time?

this was my screen time 2 days ago and that’s just one day alone. i honestly
have a dependency on the phone, i wake up and i don’t know anything else to do
other than go on like tiktok or instagram. i would rather it be like 4 hours max
a day. my daily average is a little above 8 hours which is crazy to really think
about and i just don’t even know what to do

 Delete instagram 
 
     100% I read an article somewhere (I think it was LinkedIn) that said   Meta makes approximately $0.27 for
    each hour that an average user spends on Instagram.        Meta makes approximately $0.28 for each hour
    that an average Facebook user spends on the platform.     After I read that, I realized that every minute
    I spend on that platform is making someone else money, while I sit there & scroll.

     I found deleting social media app made the biggest difference in my screen time. Accessing social media
    sites through the browser makes it unattractive and drastically reduces the time spent on those sites.
    Same with shopping apps. I used to buy random stuff  from Amazon when I am bored thinking it is going to
    somehow make me happy. Deleted the app and I am proud to say didn’t buy anything for the last two weeks
    except a supplement which I take everyday!

     Delete Instagram, replace with reddit.

     This is the ultimate solution. I've been instagram free since 2021 and life has been amazing since then.
    Before that I was as extereme as having suicidal thoughts at one point.

     This. Deleted it* about a year ago and it feels phenomenal

     You can delete it off your phone and still access it on a computer via Instagram.com - I’ve done this many
    times and every time my mental health goes up immediately and significantly. I still check it about once a
    day but I spend maybe 5-10 mins and I’m done. I can’t post on my story so I’m not checking for likes or
    replies but if people send me DMs I can see and respond. Makes me feel not as disconnected but not
    attached to it on my phone.

     I Love how everyone here is saying ""delete all social media"" while we're on Reddit lmao

     Great idea! And yes the cinema is the perfect “screen time but not really this kind of screen time” for
    making weaning off social media a bit easier. 2 and a 1/2 hours at the movie theater is probably much more
    memorable content than 2 and a 1/2 hours of Instagram, and it doesn’t kill your dopamine receptors as
    much.



 Delete your instagram account, delete the app, pick up a hobby or work. Every
time you want to open instagram, substitute it with something helpful like
doulingo or a learning app.  Your dopamine receptors are not going to enjoy that
and you’ll likely fall back to TikTok, YT shorts, reopen your instagram but you
have to keep trying. Clearly you can’t handle it and have too much time on your
hands. Learn an instrument, language, go on walks, pick up a skill. If you have
all that free time, might as well put it towards something you can be proud of.
Best of luck to you

 Switch to Android. Apple makes it too easy to override your app timers. (I have
an iPad and an Android phone, I definitely notice a difference.) Set a 5 minute
timer for Instagram. Unfollow accounts you don’t truly care about. Delete
TikTok, it’s just a time suck. Weaning sucks, but it does get better with time.
Edit: Since setting a 5 minute timer on Instagram, I’ve become more mindful of
what I do when I open the app. I usually only spend 30 seconds to one minute on
there at a time before I close the app. 
 


 This use to be me at a real low point in my life. Not gonna sugar coat it
quitting was hard the first month felt like quitting a drug I felt anxious and
board but I let that motivate me. Once I got over the hardest two week hump by
the end of one month the desire was almost gone. Every once in a while I miss it
but the good out ways the bad by far. I have a bunch of hobbies now, read, watch
movies, workout, volunteer, and meditate. I agree with others that deleting
things all together is the best way to go. I also recommend reading or audiobook
Digital Minimalism and The Shallows to help you. Edit: I have been “phone sober”
for  almost five years now 2020 really opened my eyes that I needed to make
changes. You can do it!

 Yeah def, for me it was forced child labor. Couldn’t really escape that. I don’t
think I can blame myself for it either though. Some things can’t be instantly
fixed by getting hobbies and working out and touching grass. EMDR is needed for
this shit. 
 


 You can also go the opposite route and stay insanely busy getting things done
and making progress rather than sitting alone with your feelings and fears,
which is what I do most of the time. :P 
 


 while i agree to some degree I do think its important to recognize the way we as
a society have failed one another. Theres way too much individualism in this
world thats leading to a loneliness epidemic for not just men but women too. I
think the biggest problem is society assuming that women have things more
figured out than men do. My partner runs into this concerning stuff like family
and mental health, she is always assumed to struggle less with her mental health
than any males in her family because shes female. The family and i think society
too assumes that only men struggle super hard with mental illness and basically
with everything. Women struggle just as much though.  I cant tell you how many
times older women in my life who dont have a spouse or kids are just ""assumed""
to be moms and wives just because of their age and race. Its a bit insulting
actually. Its like people cant see women of color as individuals and like
they're just seen as these submissive baby machines.  Its like people assume
women over 30 in 2025 who arent white revolve around their supposed husband and
kids. Do we all just think brown women of a certain age dont have hobbies or
aspirations? A career? What is going on? I think thats a tragedy. And so because
of this there are some women out there who are very lonely and feel strange in
their own skin because society has labeled them as something they arent.  From
there, do they pretend? How do you have these conversations with people you
barely met who just assume and put you in a box?   Its tough out there for
everybody so I wouldnt say its as simple as ""You arent working hard enough bro""
and that life is a bit more complicated for folks over the age of 21. We are all
going through different things and its very complex.  In short, yes, digital
minimalism does serve a purpose; which is that of being a liberator for those
who are shackled to their phones but for older folks they might find that the
reason they have shackled themselves to their phone is because no one befriends
them or because they are seen as the odd one out because they dont have kids and
a spouse. Society limits you once you get over 30 and a lot of people who dont
have many friends or family will find its a very lonely life without their
phones. 
 


 I'm realizing the same during the last couple of months. Honestly i cant imagine
having around 2 hours screentime. But that's kinda telling. 
 
     Please, spending less time digitally has got to be the best decision I’ve made in my 15 years of living.
    I’ve never been so happy.

Long flight tips for kids that don't do screen time,"Long flight tips for kids that don't do screen time

We will be travelling with 3 kids under 5 soon. The flight is around 10 hours
and I'm after ideas to keep them entertained. Unfortunately reading to them
won't be an option as I get bad motion sickness. Anything that doesn't involve
me would be great so I can focus on not being sick.

 This is the time for screens. It will be very special and will cause them
absolutely no harm. 
 
     Honestly yeah I don’t do screen time but if we went on a plane with 3 under 5 for 10 hours you bet your
    ass some screen time would be involved lol, you can tell them it was special for that time on the plane/ a
    vacation treat.

     For the sake of everyone on the plane 

     Yeah pretty much. Not all screen time is created equal! Long form entertainment with an educational bent
    and a moral lesson is way different than a bunch of dopamine farming on tiktok or candy crush or whatever!
    Load the tablet up with classic sesame Street, old school Disney, or whatever you like in that vein. Kid
    safe headphones and alternate between that and some non tech toys.



 A bag of new toys, colouring books, etc.  Bring them out one at a time.   Ditto
bag of snacks  Ensure they're tired, but not cranky over tired, when you get on
the flight .  I assume audiobooks won't work for them? Blankets, blow-up pillows
for sleep.    Good luck 
 


 Mom of 4 here with some decently long flights alone with my kids under my belt.
Doodle boards, coloring, novel snacks and pop-it toys are fun for about 10
minutes. This is the time for screens. Get quality headphones and a screen for
everyone with movies and a couple simple games downloaded. 10 hours is a loooong
time in a tiny seat. Hopefully you have an evening flight and they can sleep for
some of it.  
 
     I've got to agree.  We took my 2yr old on a transatlantic flight and charged up my old phone and
    downloaded some of their favorite stuff, mostly Ms Rachel and Super Simple Songs, and a favorite movie.
    Now that they're preschool age they prefer radio/audio books, like the story cards yoto publishes (we
    listen to them all together in long car rides and some of them are really good quality, not baby crack).
    Also got them a kid sized Bluetooth headphone.  We did have some decent engagement with the fold open
    scenes that have vinyl cling ""stickers"" in them.  However, our idea of ""take a red eye and hopefully the
    kids will sleep most of it"" was wildly naive, and the next 36 hours were _rough _. Coming back we took a
    morning departure/afternoon arrival and that was so much better for the kids.  Comes down to the
    individual kid though, I don't doubt a lot of kids would be cool sleeping onboard, just not ours.



 Um, you’re looking for a way to calm and divert your “3 kids under 5” for a 10
hour flight that “doesn’t involve you?”   😬🤷‍♀️  Hope you have a lovely vacation
tho 😬👍 
 
     I hope they’re geniuses that can read chapter books before kindergarten  Seriously what else would they do
    than watch tv, that doesn’t disturb others  Expose them to quality, comprehensible input, which will
    accelerate their language acquisition and sophistication.



 My friend bought a tablet for this reason. Her son thinks it only works in the
plane. He is 3 so this works for now. 
 
     If it’s a 10 hour flight the plane should have screens on the seats with kid friendly shoes and movies.
    But a tablet will be good for pre-downloaded educational games !! That way it’s not a complete brain rot
    flight lol

     Honestly, we didn’t even need to lie to our then 3 year old about this. When we took a 10 hour flight with
    him, he got 3 hours of screentime on the way out before falling asleep, and probably 8 coming back.
    Completely out of our norm. When we got home, he knew our boundaries and didn’t turn into some screentime
    monster.   We’re very low screens compared to other parents in our circles. That said, we see plane
    screentime as part of our strategy to not be so hardcore anti-screen that our kid sees it as the forbidden
    fruit.

     I have iPads for my kids (4&5) that mysteriously only are found just before a flight or car ride longer
    than two hours. So crazy.



 Pack an activity bag. Toys that don't make noise, coloring books, puzzles. Not a
parent but maybe look into Montessori toys? I know the focus with those is
learning and engagement so they're more likely to be analog toys.    You can
also get a Walkman/disc and some childrens books on tape/CD. Highly HIGHLY
recommend trying to track down some Rabbitears Radio cassettes. It was a NPR
program when I was a kid where they narrated different stories and had songs to
go with them. I had Jack and the Beanstalk on cassette as a kid. I know they've
also got a product now, I forget what it's called but I saw it at Target before
the boycott started. They're essentially the same thing: a small audio player
with a proprietary cartridge and you buy different cartridges of children's
stories. Comes with a headphone jack. 
 


 Portable DVD players and DVDs from the library. Those markers that only mark on
special paper (you do not want a kid to go crazy with marker on the plane
window/seat back while you rest your eyes). Let them go crazy in the airport at
an empty gate so they can get tired. Snacks and water bottles. 
 


 By “kids that don’t do screen time” do you mean that it doesn’t work well enough
to keep them occupied or you don’t typically allow it? When my kids were smaller
I would pack every conceivable thing from doodle boards to sticker books to
snacks and they’d be bored quickly no matter what. As others have said this is
absolutely the time for screen time, especially if you don’t want to be
personally managing their entertainment the whole time. 
 


 Travel version of ‘traffic,’, coloring books, a little tape recorder so they can
make up and tell each other stories, stickers, special snacks, age appropriate
workbooks and a prize at tue end of the flight… 
 


 Audiobooks or those recorded picture books that play the story aloud to kids,
snacks to dole out one at a time (gummies, dried fruit, etc), painter's tape and
plastic cups, new toys they've never seen before like Magnatiles and fresh
coloring books.   Can your partner read to them? If you're sick, they need to
step up.

Can someone please suggest a screen time app that actually worked for them?,"Can someone please suggest a screen time app that actually worked for them?

I tried Opal, Jomo, Screenzen and a few more but I keep deleting them. Have any
of you found success with one of those apps?

 If you like deleting apps so much, why don't you delete the distracting ones?
And don't say you need them, you're happy to delete a screen time app even
though you clearly need it.  Btw screenzen is awesome, you just have to actually
use it's functionality. No app will fix your habits just by installing it. 
 
     Second this! The only thing that really worked for me was getting ruthless with deleting or disabling the
    distracting apps themselves, like you said. At first it sucked, but after a few days I barely noticed.

     You got a point. I use social media for passing time and connecting with friends. It's not that they are
    evil, it's that i just use them too much, I don't want to unistall them



 i used to delete mine too lol. what kinda helped me was one sec and stayfree,
they don’t block you too hard but remind you just enough to feel guilty and
close the app. small wins over full bans 
 


 What makes you delete them?   Screenzen worked great for me but you need to have
some self discipline 
 
     I don't know tbh. I downloaded and deleted it a few times. I might try it again



 No. They honestly sucks.  What helped me was getting so frustrated about this
that I learned how to code and build one.  The funny thing is that since I now
had a goal in my mind ( I mean building something ) I started using my phone
less. The lesson I learned is that you have to find something more interesting
to do instead of scrolling through your phone. I was literally thinking and
coding all night, it was amazing. I had no time or stimuli for scrolling TikTok
or any of those bs. Live your life instead of watching someone else’s. But I
know not everyone can or want to engage in creating something, and social media
is of course part of our social life. My app is basically a time wallet, you set
a daily goal (mine is 1h) and each time you open a social media it asks you how
much time you plan to stay (1,2,5 minutes etc.) then it kicks you out. If you
want to try it it’s called ‘BLOCKR’.  I wish you best luck my friend 
 
     Thank you for such insight. Can you link your app? I cannot find it



 Lately I’m thinking it’s not just about limits, but how the feed itself works.
Like a finite scroll, fewer rage-bait posts, or only showing stuff that actually
matters. Do you think changing the way content shows up, instead of just
blocking apps, could actually help stick to a plan? Curious what would work for
people. 
 
     this is what worked for me. i downloaded something that gets rid of the ""newsfeed""



 Yeah, on ScreenZen you can set the app so that it's impossible to uninstall
without the code.  Someone else set my code and if I wanted to I can't uninstall
the app.  Works charms for lack of self-control, you've got no choice really. 
 


 you have to do 2 things simulataneously, unlearn that behaviour of scrolling and
practicing something meaningful(building or creating something)  1/ for
unlearning, you have to practice ""boredem sprints"", like going to washroom or
walking without phone, in starting it will uneasy and somewhat exhausting but
within 3-4 days it will get easier, remember sprint one context at a time, first
unlearn from washroom times than from walking then eating then other areas.   2/
build or create something that you can visualise, drawing, coding, journaling,
instrument ,whatever you like.   I'm assuming that you delete blockers because
you get pissed off, which is natural. now when you practice above 2, especially
building something, that frustration from blockers will reduce and you'll start
reasoning your way out from those urges and frustrations.      and remember i
said practice, it means you won't get it perfectly the first time, start from
one context and spread to others. you have to work from the roots. bloclers just
solves superficial problem. 
 


 I coughed up the money for Brick and it works for me. I don’t want to quit
social media altogether but I do have times of the day when I need to stop
scrolling. 
 
     From reading about Brick, it seems great for when you leave the house, but for me when I'm out and about
    is generally when I am engaging with others and the world. When I'm at home is when I don't want to get
    sucked into scrolling. How does it work for you at home?



 I’ve been using the paid version of Minimal (\~$10) and it’s worked wonders for
me. I use it on my tablet and my phone! There’s a “digital detox” setting so you
can block certain apps and sites at certain times or on specific days, and the
widgets that replace your app icons are a lot less tempting/distracting than
having the colorful squares everywhere. I went the extra mile and turned my
phone on grayscale mode too, and within a week my screen time dropped
drastically. :) 
 


 i really really love One Sec. been using it for almost 2 years to spend less
time on Instagram (I deleted tiktok a while back now) and it does a fantastic
job at keeping me in check. i’ve put multiple friends onto it!

Looking for hobbies suggestions to cut down screen time,"Looking for hobbies suggestions to cut down screen time

Hey everyone! So I work in tech (data science) which means I'm staring at
screens literally all day. By the end of the workday, my brain is fried. Like,
totally done. And that makes it really hard to do anything that requires focus,
like learning a new language or diving into some deep, intellectual hobby. I
just don’t have the mental bandwidth after analyzing data and writing code all
day. (Before anyone suggests I already hit the gym regularly. So physical
activity is covered).  What I’m looking for is some kind of low-effort, ideally
hands-on hobby I can do at home that doesn’t involve screens, isn’t super
expensive, and doesn’t require intense mental focus. Basically something chill
to help me unwind that doesn’t involve scrolling Reddit or watching YouTube for
hours on autopilot (which is what usually happens).

 I read fiction for this reason. Reading isn't super intensive on my brain, and
even if I get invested in a story, it's not the real world so my energy depletes
differently. I also learned to mend clothing, which is something I can do
mindlessly especially if it's hemming jeans or darning holes in my socks. If I
feel like getting up, I like watching birds and keeping track of how plants
change over time. 
 
     Reading fiction seems like a really good idea! Last year I re read Harry Potter series and was really easy
    to follow along. Ty!

     Perfect time to start. A lot of libraries are starting their Summer Reading programs! 



 If you're too tired to focus on a book, try reading a magazine about something
that interests you. 
 
     I second this.  Magazines are an easy, entertaining way to read.  I wish the libraries let you take them
    home.   They can be pricey for what you get.

     Good idea, close to my home there are a used books shop which have a lot of affordable ones.



 how about picking up a beginner-level
[goovebox](https://youtu.be/S1Loz8HZr1E?si=jSSiFKlfRaIHuR0H) (i.e. a self-
contained synth, drum, machine, sequencer, sampler) and spend some time bleeping
and blooping. they're a lot of fun.   (the link above is a YouTube primer on
groove boxes) 
 
     [deleted]

     It's look too hard, I don't know anything about music, lol.



 I know you said something at home, but as an alternative, I started photography.
It got me outside, slowed me down, got me to appreciate being in the moment and
has allowed me to see the world differently.  I use a camera, not a phone as I
appreciate the process of photography.  I’m not someone who takes hundreds of
photos, rather spend time looking at the environment.  If you haven’t done non
phone photography before, there will be a learning curve.  I have also found it
has reduced my stress.  Sitting waiting for the right light, or stalking an
animal for the right angle, then the thrill of knowing you got the shot.  It has
changed my life. 
 
     Excelent idea! Going to try it out!



 This isn't so hands on and it does involve screen but I've been replacing my
unproductive screen time with doing fun Anki decks on geography, birds,
different numerals systems, trivia, and many more. I find it fun and it doesn't
use much brain power--for me at least. 
 


 Magazines Origami Knitting Gardening Baking Colouring 
 
     Good ideas!



 Whittling is fun and relaxing. Juggling is too.   For sitting still I like
reading easy novels, or doing crosswords.   Also strangely I’ve found learning
guitar to be doable even when my brain is fried. Definitely can’t learn music
theory when I’m tired, but just sitting there practicing changing chords or
strum patterns/picking patterns is a nice relaxing way to pass the time.  
 
     Whittling really looks interesting, I'll give a shot!



 I think reading would be something you could enjoy. I am in a maybe similar
position (school + part-time software engineering) and it's what I do. Works
pretty well. 
 
     If your brain is fried from work you could also try out audio books. You can pick up the Libby app and
    borrow audio books from your local library.



 Check out a line called metal Earth. They make little models that don't require
glue. They're a lot of fun 🙂 
 
     It's look really fun! Going to check it out!



 I find experimenting with cooking a good way to get away from screens. Explore
new cuisines, ingredients and techniques. It can turn a chore into a fun
creative activity.

lonely, and social media promises false connection. 
 


 [removed] 
 
     Thanks for your advice 

     No self-promo allowed 

     I heavily second turning off notifications! That’s the one that has helped me most. Because I’m not
    turning the screen on “just to see if something happened”, which then turns into actually using the phone.
    Calls, texts, and my work-app notifies me when it’s an hour before my shift!

     Going off that 1st point, the One Sec app helped tremendously. I installed it to trigger when I open
    Instagram and it makes me wait like 10 seconds before proceeding. Half the time, I’m like “wait yeah I
    actually don’t want to scroll rn”



 I used a ton of screen blocking apps and the best one I found is Moshen. It
sucks it’s only on the App Store so I can’t recommend to some of my friends, but
it lets you lock whatever apps you want and the only way to unlock them is to
exercise - it tracks your steps, calories burned, even time spent at the gym.
You can pick how many steps convert to a minute of screen time - ex. 100 steps
unlocks a minute. I would really recommend! 
 
     lol actually sounds like a great app!

     I just downloaded it

     Do you pay for this?



 I was at 17 hours/day!!!  I'm now at 4 hours/day.  I just try to lesson by 2
hours each week. 
 
     What have you replaced all that time with? :)



 Well hold on now. What apps are the Info&Reading and Pro&Finance? I mean
depending on what you’re doing on your Mac, if some of this is for a job then
obviously you’re not crazy but you have some room to improve your habits I would
say! 
 


 I was in the habit of charging my phone when I was using it because I couldn’t
stop. I got rid of all my chargers except for a wireless charger that I have to
let it charge up to use it. It helped me stay off a few hours. I totally
recommend getting rid of all your chargers and except the wireless!!! 
 
     Wow! Great advice. My phone is all the time in the charger 



 It's definitely bad but I've seen worse. 7 hours of Reddit is a lot though and I
would attempt to address that first. Add some kind of limiter extension and set
a cap for an hour or so. 
 


 Do you find you spend a lot of time jumping from one app to the next over and
over again? 
 
     I do. What would you say about that behavior?



 Delete the social media apps you use the most and mute notifications . Pick a
non digital hobby or exercise . Anything that doesn’t involve a phone or laptop
or tablet or computer .

Stay at home mom screen time alternatives,"Stay at home mom screen time alternatives

Hi everyone! I’m a stay at home mom to an amazing 4 month old baby. I have
noticed my screen time going up in the day as I use it while she naps because
it’s something that feels like I can shut my mind off. I hate seeing how much
time I’m on the phone and always feel bad at the end of the day when I’ve used
it too much.  What are some hobbies or activities that both keep you awake but
don’t take too much energy? Also any tips for cutting back?  I already love
reading but feel like even that is too focused for how tired I am sometimes.

 try to have some YOU time while she’s asleep, do something YOU like to do. if
you like to paint your nails, do it, do your makeup, a face mask, read your
favorite book, eat your favorite snack. often as new mothers yall forget that
YOU matter too.  if you want specific ideas, crochet. it keeps your hands busy
and it’s very time consuming but you could also learn to make things for baby!
cross stitching and hand embroidery are fun too, i got starter kits at hobby
lobby for like $5 a piece.   i’m trying to learn to garden and how to cook
better while im off a screen lol, it’s the little things. 
 
     Seriously—I would take naps when your child naps.  But if you are too awake, you can read or maybe get
    into genealogy! It’s a lot of fun and you find out so many interesting things.  Or do an exercise video or
    some baking.  There are plenty of things to do!

     OP I'm echoing this times a million. Once upon a time, (10 years ago) I began to give all of myself to my
    young growing family... Screen time was my unwind time.. everything else takes more effort. i didn't know
    how empty (unfulfilling) the screen time was. As time went on, everything magnified. I thought I was being
    a modern, selfless, do it all mom. Seemed like a flex to be this super mom character...   Over time, I was
    chipping away at myself unintentionally and I had no clue. Sorry sent over. Best wishes



 I like doing my makeup or reading the news. Sitting down and enjoying a meal.
But honestly I don’t beat myself up too much for being on screens during nap. I
am tired. 
 


 I think maybe just taking that time do nice things for yourself, whatever that
might be. Eat a healthy meal, put on some lotion, read a book if you feel like
it, tweeze your eyebrows, whatever floats your boat. 
 


 Paint by numbers!  Some of those kits are gorgeous and it puts you in a total
zen state. 
 


 Get a special candle to light where you hang out during nap time, so it’s a
little “me time” sensory experience and marker for you! Then flip through a
magazine or something that doesn’t require deep reading. I check out most of the
magazines at the library to save money!  
 


 Jigsaw puzzle? I like to do a jigsaw puzzle while listening to a podcast, but
you need a space that you can baby proof for the puzzle. Little bit of
stretching, a crossword or Sudoku, reading a magazine. 
 


 This is something I’ve been struggling with lately. I downloaded an app called
ScreenZen that will lock the apps you use most, and set a time limit (like 5
minutes, 5 times a day) that you can use it before kicking you off. It’s really
helped me.   I also have removed apps I use frequently (Facebook, certain games,
etc) from my Home Screen on my phone so if I want them, I have to go looking for
them. This helps me not mindlessly click on it 100 times a day.   I usually read
when baby is feeding or napping on me, or we will sit outside and just leave my
phone inside so we can both just watch birds and cars go by. I put up bird
feeders so it’s like one of our activities for the day to go watch the birds
lol. 
 


 If you like to read, maybe try brain candy type books. not necessarily dirty,
but books written simply with easy to follow, but engaging plots. I also have
noticed giving up a lot of screen time after a while has allowed me to focus on
books more.   Also, sudoku or fill-it-in type books.   Reality TV with a lap
craft, like cross stitch, crochet, etc.   Let baby sleep in the stroller and go
for walks with a podcast.  Also, I find puzzles to be really fun and relaxing to
let your mind disconnect without too much effort. 
 


 I was listening a lot of things… my brain couldn’t digest an audiobook or
something… I was listening different shows. Some shows are made the way that you
don’t have to watch🙂 not Netflix. Some of them can be quite educational. 
 
     Any favorite shows?



 I put the library app on my phone and I borrow audiobooks.

Why Did Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Limit Screen Time for Their Kids?,"Why Did Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Limit Screen Time for Their Kids?

We see the mounting studies now that excessive screen use affects attention,
emotional regulation, sleep, and brain development, especially in children and
teens.  MRI studies from the NIH’s *Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development*
project show links between **high screen time and thinner cortex regions** which
is tied to language and executive function.  The big tech icons like Steve Jobs
and Bill Gates strictly limited their kids’ screen use.   Jobs wouldn’t let his
children use iPads at home and Gates delayed smartphones entirely.  It feels
like as a society we underestimating the cognitive costs of constant screen
exposure?  Do any parents put in screen limits for their own children?  Curious
what others think

 I can’t imagine anyone on this sub thinks unlimited screen time is healthy.
Tech CEOs limiting their children’s screen time seems like a reasonable thing
any parent would do.   The CEO of Coca-Cola probably doesn’t let their kids
drink Coke constantly. 
 
     The CEO of Coca-Cola unfortunately didn't invent coke or carbonated drinks altogether. It's interesting
    looking at creators/visionaries and how they viewed their inventions at a broader context



 Yep I have a nearly 3 year old and we have rules around screens. She never gets
a personalised screen (like ipad or phone) and she won't until she is much much
older. The only screen she gets is the TV, which isn't connected to any
channels. We have DVDs and vcrs that she can choose from, and pictures of TV
shows that she can watch but we have to cast from our phones for her. We give
her the pics so she has something physical to browse. All of this is to take
away the instant gratification and dopamine fix of an endless scroll. That kind
of thing is hard enough for adults to resist, let alone a child.  We also have a
strict no TV in the morning policy, and no TV after dinner (though when she's
older I imagine we might do a Friday family movie night or something). The only
time she really watches is during the week, for 30 mins to an hour while I'm
cooking dinner and it would be dangerous to have her underfoot.  Edit: having
DVDs and things is also good cause she watches the same episodes rather than
constantly having new stimulus. She's more engaged on rewatches because she
comments about what's happening/what's going to happen, she learns the songs and
sings along, etc. The stories become recognisable to her and she re-enacts them
in her play time (current favourite is pretending to be postman pat while I
pretend to be his black and white cat lol) 
 


 Because they won't let their kids get high from their own supply. 
 


 Tech CEOs are intimately aware of social media's effects on the brain,
especially on young children. Scientific studies have likened the effects of
endless scrolling to a brain on drugs.  Developing this addiction while the
brain is also still developing will have a life-long impact on the individual's
concentration and mood.   They don't care (rather, they likely benefit) if the
rest of the population grows into mindless zombies, but it sure as hell wont be
*their* kids! 
 
     Yes - that really does tell you alot. Allowing their children to stay away from the detriments of the
    technology that they have got the mass likes of people addicted too. We need to take back full control but
    seems like we've slipped into the matrix now



 They have nannies. People use screens as nannies.

changes as they age. And the rules on what is allowed changes.

hour of recreational time"" is a hard sell, to... well, both of us. My coparent
has also requested that our child be given unlimited screen time on Fridays and
Saturdays, as it teaches her the lesson that days off are for unrestricted
screwing-off time (which I don't agree with but you gotta pick and choose your
battles in coparenting).  I have, however, completely banned shortform content
and AI. There is a reason that one of YouTube's cofounders doesn't let his kids
on shortform content. And AI should go without saying. Y'know, because it may
actually kill us someday. 
 
     Ah that does sound like a difficult situation but work in progress as you say, for everyone. I'm not too
    clued up on the short-form content and it's effects (Thinking TIK-Tok here!) but i guess its like getting
    that perfect little hit of dopamine where you want more and more and more. AI and kids I feel is a very
    dangerous mix - there should literally be a ban on any child using it, globally.



 i would too if I had a zillion dollars and could just give them the pony they
are looking at on the screen. .. 
 


 As a parent to a 3 year old, yes we are conscious of screens especially iPads. 
We don’t allow ours to use an iPad unless on a flight. Otherwise at home we
watch TV and movies but stick away from short form content or trash baby
hypnotic shows.   It’s scary how many new parents toss over an iPad to the baby
and the rest is history. 
 
     Thats really good! I've seen it ever so often though - crying baby, an iPad thrown right in front of them
    to shut them up so said parent can 'have some peace'. Definitely not the right way, especially for a
    child's development, understanding of the world and impact on the brain at such a tender age



 Selling a product is different than using a product. 
 
     Agree there! However, the spin is if its well and safe to sell it should be well and safe to use also -
    that is in itself a validation of what is being sold.

What are the best methods you’ve found to actually reduce screen time?,"What are the best methods you’ve found to actually reduce screen time?

No BS, no theory   What are the most effective real things you’ve done that
actually helped you spend less time on your phone or computer?  I’m trying to
collect the best methods people have figured out. Would love to hear whatever
worked for you: apps, rules, mindset shifts, anything.  Thanks in advance.

 Making social commitments. Phone overuse for me was due to to loneliness and
social media having de-incentivized connection. No fancy apps to dig my grave
deeper with, just a general sense of ""If I want to connect I'll have to tell
someone"". A lot of self advocating for my needs - asking a person if they wanted
to hang out, or searching for social events I'd like. Talking to strangers
instead of scrolling.   I also have social commitments to myself. Instead of
numbing out my insecurities in a vaguepost or rabbit hole, I'll journal and work
my shit out. 
 
     Great point. I've noticed I don't have the urge to mindlessly scroll when I'm on vacation or doing
    something fun with friends/family. Even if there's down time I just don't have a reason to. Being at home
    though is a completely different story. It's important to identify and treat the root of the problem.

     This is the answer for me. When I'm with people, I become wary of using my phone and appear disrespectful
    so I only use it when needed and pay attention to what's happening around me. 



 I had my husband set up screen time limits on my phone (iPhone)- so I don't have
the passcode. The limits are such that there is no browser access, no apps, etc.
I also have the black and white color filter and a matte screen protector, so
it's less pleasant to look at in general. It is basically a home phone that also
has facetime. Those limits don't exist on my other device (laptop) but it is
tedious enough that I don't use it at nearly the same rate.  As far as mindset
shifts so, I'm a mother. It occurred to me that I value my time so much that I
am willing to sell basically none of it to data farmers. Secondly, I gave up
following the news because I couldn't deal with the anxiety it gave me. And
ultimately I felt I owe my children my joy, and anything that robs me of that
joy had to go. I'm down to >30 minutes of screen time on the phone and
>10minutes on the laptop. I regained my love for painting, reading, going on
walks, and most importantly actually being 100% present with my children-
distracted by nothing. 
 
     This is the way to do it! I also like to make my homescreen ""dumb"" by adding a minimalist launcher like
    Dumbify. Find it reduces the dopamine hit you get from your homescreen. Apple designed it to be attractive
    so you spend more time using it!



 I use an app called ScreenZen where you can lock certain apps, put time limits
on them even a screen that pauses, so if you open Instagram it will show a quote
and not open it for 3 seconds, 30 seconds 3 minutes, whatever you choose.  Of
course, you can override it, but it was nice to have some friction, wake me out
of the mindlessness of opening apps. 
 
     I just override all of these. I've found one now where you can't override it under certain conditions. 
    Honestly I bought one of those timed lock boxes from Amazon and I lock my phone in it.

     I use this too. It’s a mental note of “this much time has passed” when that concept is easily lost when
    all you do is scroll through feeds or videos. Instead of an hour passing by feeling like it was 25 mins, I
    get the heads up notification of “30 seconds left til app closes” and I know that means it’s been 20
    minutes on that app. I’m able to use this, and I simply say, time to do something else with myself for a
    while. Some days are easier than others.



 Grayscale is all that works for me. Problem is I keep telling Siri to turn the
screen back to color 💀 
 
     This works for me too. Video content in particular is way less engaging in greyscale.

     You can use the ""shortcuts"" to create automations for the apps where you feel it's useful to see colours,
    like the photo gallery or photocamera, so when you open these apps the screen turns back to colour and
    then when you exit the app it turns to greyscale again.

 I’m actually trying to make my screen time MORE enjoyable by curating,
commenting, participating more. So instead of the slot machine of
boring,boring,boring…INTERESTING which gets us all addicted to the scroll.  I
have more interesting things to see and get “satiated” quicker.  Less screentime
overall, more enjoyment of it.  Closing reddit now! 
 
     Also, on iPhone there is an option to require a passcode to open an app. Set that up by holding on the app
    icon to edit and then Require Passcode is one of the menu options, as well as Remove from Home Screen.
    That provides a level of friction if you need to have that moment to ask yourself why you’re even opening
    the app.



 So far, it's switching from an iPhone to an Android. My screen time was like 9
hours on my iPhone and it's about 2.5 hours on my S25 Ultra; I've only had it
for about a week though. 
 
     Lmao speaks volumes of how shitty android ux is. Sorry as a web dev that’s hilarious



 I spent the most time on Instagram, Youtube, Reddit and reading mangas.   1.
Instagram   Installed Distraction Free Instagram so I can see only the messages
and still post something if I need to.    Went from 2 hours to 1 minute daily. 
2. Youtube   Turned off search history and unsubscribed all channels. Now I
don't get suggested videos and can only watch something if I specifically write
it in the search bar.    Now I only put on a smosh video on background while
working.     3. Screen   Made my whole phone monochrome, to take out the
overstimulation part of it and make it more boring.    It feels much more like a
tool right now than something to stimulate and distract myself with.      4.
Reddit and manga   These two are the ones I'm working with right now. I set a
time period on my calendar everyday of when I can indulge in these. It's easier
to do this now after doing the other parts and feeling the benefits of it. 
5. Grabbing my phone first thing in the morning.    I've tried many things of
replacing it after reading others suggestions and nothing worked. But today I
grabbed my kindle instead of my phone, and the thing is I can't go on reading
for a long period of time, it's usually about 15 minutes, while on my phone time
just flies. So reading seems to work well for me as an alternative.  
 
     What's that Distraction free instagram  Can you share the link



 [deleted] 
 
     Helps me to keep it somewhere other than my pocket.  If I'm at home it's on the mantelpiece or the bedroom
    dresser.

     Ooh. Hadn’t thought about that. Gonna see if there’s a widget I can set up for my app blocker/ST monitor.

"If you find ""screen time"" apps don't work to get you off your phone, try something that uses a real incentive","If you find ""screen time"" apps don't work to get you off your phone, try something that uses a real incentive

TLDR: I made a fully free app that keeps you off your phone thru cash penalties
I was so fed up with wasting time on my phone, constantly checking for
notifications, falling down social media rabbit holes, and wasting my life away.
I tried every app and trick in the book to cut back on screen time, but nothing
stuck. I'd set reminders to put my damn phone down, only to ignore them. I'd set
app limits, but then just bypass them. I even tried the full Newport detox,
uninstalling all apps, going greyscale, etc - didn't cut it. It was hella
demoralizing.  That's when I realized I needed to have skin in the game and see
real consequences if I bailed on my goals. And that's how Cobweb was born. It's
a free app that doesn't try to block ""bad"" apps, it blocks the whole phone for a
set period of time and penalizes you if you try to override it.  Here's how it
works:  1. Set a goal for how long you want to stay off your phone 2. Put some
cash on the line  3. If you cave and use your phone before your goal time is up,
you forfeit the cash *-- Don't worry, goes to The Center for Humane Technology*
4. If you succeed, congrats! You stayed free of your phone keep the cash  It's
been working well for me so far -- when I know that there's real cash on the
line (I use about $15, which is sadly what it takes to make me think twice) I
stay off my phone almost 100% of the time I try to. I've only failed once since
using this system, and that was when I only put $5 on at first.  Curious for any
thoughts from this community, appreciate your guys' take

 I love it! Thanks for sharing, OP. This could work for me. 
 
     That’s awesome :) let me know if you have any questions or feedback I’m happy to help!



 I like this concept but I’d like to choose who to give my cash to. I’m happy to
tip the developers and I don’t have an issue with The Center for Humane
Technology but maybe I could choose an organization I hate? That would really
motivate me…I can see myself reaching for my phone and going “aw hell no, fuck
those dudes” 😆 
 
     Haha fair yeah; it’s just a lot more logistically complex for me to deal with multiple different donations
    at this point! But I hear you and will keep that in mind as an idea



 This is great. I downloaded screen Zen but always bypass the limits I set for
myself. I am definitely addicted and I think this could work for me. 
 
     Dude that’s exactly why I made this haha. I would do the same thing.   If you check it out let me know and
    I am always happy to chat hear feedback and take your suggestions

     Someone in this sub recommended ScreenZen and I also found myself bypassing the limits but then I set up
    the hard block option so my scrolling/swipey apps are blocked from when I wake up to 1 PM and blocked
    again starting at 9 PM. Helps me not begin and end my day w scrolling



 That’s a good idea, what I’m doing now is using apple screen time and someone’s
else has the password and I told them not to give it to me and I have the
freedom premium app so I can block apps for the rest of the day once I hit my
time limit and there’s no way to turn it off unless I had the apple screen time
password 
 
     That’s also a solid solution!! Mine is more hardcore in that it keeps you off the phone entirely, but if
    more specific app blocking is doing the trick for you I say keep up the good work haha :)



 I love this idea and going to download.   I bought a lock box for my phone that
you cannot get into before the timer runs out without breaking it, but I’ve had
it a year and my phone has been in ONCE.  I need serious help. Having ADHD makes
this phone addiction wild. 
 
     I hear you 100%. One other thing it has is a commitment mode where you choose how long you want to stay
    off your phone for each day and then if you don’t complete that daily goal you get hit with a penalty.
    It’s something you can layer on so that you’re not relying just on your own self motivation to start a
    session each day.  Any questions always feel free to get in touch because I’m looking for ways to improve
    it



 Wow this is a genius idea, I'm going to give it a shot 
 
     Awesome if you have any thoughts feel free to DM me here or you can contact me in the app as well! Always
    trying to make updates and improve it based on folks feedback

     When available on android?



 just checking - you can't use your phone at all? what if you get a phone call?
would that resulted in the forfeited money? 
 
     incoming phone calls are exempted! But yes most other actions are blocked. If you download it there are
    specifics that you can check out the instructions are pretty comprehensive



 Is this on Google Play? 
 
     Sadly not at the moment I don’t have experience developing for android



 lol that’s one way to do it if you’re really that addicted I guess. I’m not that
bad but I could see it working if you’re just not able to use self control 
 
     How’s the weather up there on that high horse? One of the key points of digital minimalism is that phones
    are made to be addicting and they suck people in. Some people need an extra boost to help them not use
    their phone. I literally lock mine up with a timer so that I can take a break. I hate that, “just have
    some self control” nonsense.

     yes I'd say it's only necessary if you've tried other apps that are more gently but find that they're not
    working for you

People are becoming zombies,"People are becoming zombies

I was out for lunch with my dad today and he spent the majority of the time on
his phone, occasionally looking up to talk about what he was reading. In our
whole afternoon together, he kept receiving phone calls and pausing our
conversation to take them. When I looked around the cafe, there were two teenage
girls, both on their phones. A mother and her child on their phones. A family
with dad on his phone.  I recently had a friend stay and she would use her phone
constantly. We needed to get the bus and she pulled out google maps to show me
where the bus stop was, “I know, I’ve lived her 10 months” was my reply, which
seemed to disgruntle her. By the end of her visit, she admitted to me that she
had become self conscious of how much she used her phone- I hadn’t mentioned it
once to her.  I have another friend who uses it anytime there’s confusion in
conversation. Say we are talking and have different understandings, she will
pull out Google to find out what is “right”. I remember before phones, when I
was a teenager and these situations would arise, we would talk it over and over,
stretching every possibility there could be and sometimes still not come to a
conclusion, allowing imagination and mystery to fill the gaps.  I’ve dated guys
who can’t reply to texts when I’ve asked them for clarification on something
they’ve said but can post 10 stories a day about insects and games. When I’ve
followed up again, they’ve explained how they’re “overwhelmed and stressed and
have a lot of anxiety”. I don’t date these guys any more.  I was at a festival a
few months ago and the full moon was rising behind the barn. I pointed this out
to the stranger I was sat with. She pulled out her phone and said “I’m just
taking a photo to post on social media so people know I’m out haha” (no
exaggeration). As she was pulling out her phone, the moon disappeared behind a
cloud. She grew frustrated, shoving her phone back in her pocket. It reappeared
as if by magic. Rinse and repeat.  I recently walked 40 miles in the middle of
absolutely nowhere. I didn’t use my phone whilst hiking and kept it on me just
to let people know I was safe in the evening. After three days of isolation, I
entered a busy town. I couldn’t believe the amount of people just gawking at
their screens. I felt like an alien but once I was alone again and could think,
I realised how alien everyone else has become.  We have a pandemic of mental
health crisises. People feel more burned out than ever before. So much is being
replaced by phones and we are losing human contact. Is it really that difficult
to piece the two together?  I didn’t have a phone for two years out of choice. I
felt literally sick by them. My mental health in those years was the best it’s
ever been. I remember no anxiety that was outside of my surroundings. I haven’t
returned much to news or social media and I’m glad I haven’t. I asked multiple
people for the time the other day as I'd lost my watch and didn't have my phone
and with each we struck up a conversation. I like asking people for directions.
I like human connection.  I don’t give a fuck Taylor Swift is engaged. I don’t
give a fuck that Nina posted her overnight oats on her story. What even are
stories? They seem like pure egotistic brain rot to me. Who the fuck cares, you
only post it for yourself. I don’t give a fuck about reels that make my
attention span worse than a jellyfish. I don’t give a fuck about celebrities who
pollute the air and sell their souls so we buy them. I don’t give a fuck about
what your snap is. Why do people do that now? Ask for your socials without even
knowing you? Who are you? The other day a business asked me to follow them- how
the fuck do I follow a business? What? It’s like those people who make their
dogs social media accounts? It’s a fucking dog what! I don’t give a FUCK!!!  But
it’s becoming increasingly hard to not be affected by it. I honestly feel like
since the pandemic, with people isolating and having their phones attached like
an umbilical cord, that I am surrounded by zombies.  I think the Internet is
fine if it’s used like an encyclopedia but we should never have been given means
to use it socially. What I fear the most is we’ve gone too far and become too
reliant on it. And it’s ruining us as a species, far more than any atomic bomb
could. There was a study that correlated the rise in children being nonverbal
and not being communicated with because they're given a screen too young. I've
worked extensively with young people in schools and mental health institutes and
their attention span is rotting, their mental health is at an all time low.
That's the next generation. Isn't it scary?

 Im 35f. I went for a walk around my block this morning and saw all the children
waiting for the bus. Every single child, at each and every stop, was staring at
their phones. It put a pit in my stomach.   How do we even go back? My banking,
job, and all communication are via this screen. I remember the before times, and
I think millennials really long for that connection we used to have. 
 
     [deleted]

     My phone broke down recently and I couldn't turn it on. I couldn't do ANYTHING, including log into my work
    email and IT systems, NOR order a new phone online as the transaction required approval through the
    banking app. Every effing thing has a 2F authentication that requires a working phone. I never felt so
    trapped in my entire life.

     I think we as adults have to lead by example. Even baby boomers are addicted to their phones now

     it makes me most sad with the younger people as they won't know a world without it. i was on the bus once
    and a mother and toddler sat in front of me. the mum was on her phone the whole journey. i had my arm on
    the windowsill and the toddler put his hand through the gap and held my hand. i felt so sad in that
    moment, all he wanted was some attention :(

     return to flip phone. get a tablet for home use/apps and a garmin gps for car

     Seeing stuff like that makes me sick too. I switched to a Light Phone awhile ago and to be honest, it
    hasn't really been that hard. I have an iPad at home that has all apps like banking, email, etc. I keep an
    old iPhone in my glovebox so if I'm in a pinch and really need an app while driving I can use a hotspot on
    the Light Phone.

     They can coexist, that’s why I’m here. I don’t want to go back to sticks and stones and writing paychecks
    with pen and paper, exchanging good and paying with sacks of silver and gold…  The problem is all about
    awareness and self control, I would say self respect, that’s completely gone and not thought anywhere.

     The before times 😭 the long long ago

     And what’s the right response as parents

     I have a tiny smartphone that is annoying to use let alone scroll, and I use that in my day to day for
    Authenticator, my kid’s school stuff, music, and my workout program. I have my second old iPhone that is
    WiFi only at home for banking, email, etc. things we used to use computers for. And of course getting
    sucked into reddit lol it’s a great solution for me because I have no “willpower”. But I’ve noticed since
    switching, everyone is on their phones constantly. I have a friend I love dearly but I can’t hang out with
    her too long because she will constantly be pulling up instagram, not even really looking at anything just
    scrolling. She came over to watch the northern lights once and I couldn’t fucking see them because she had
    her phone out the whole time and it was bright in the pitch black 



 I’m old enough to remember seeing this change in real time. It was around 2013
and I was travelling and it was the first time I noticed everyone looking at
their phones and thinking ‘oh.’ I actually didn’t have a phone at all around
this time for a few years, but I did eventually cave, although never in a lot of
instances, like at dinner, or when in a conversation, or with friends etc. I
don’t pull out my phone when I’m waiting in line or in a waiting room at the
dentist, but most other people do.   The one thing which has become most
upsetting to me is people who I used to have great intelligent conversations
with don’t have as much to talk about anymore, they just parrot an opinion. And
they openly joke and laugh about how much they’re addicted to TikTok or reels.
And I find it genuinely terrifying how many of my peers, as parents all say the
exact same thing ‘it’s just YouTube kids’. I have seen some really questionable
things on there and the yt kids homes page is some kind of hellscape.     I do
genuinely believe we are at or about to be at the worst point of this though,
and that alternative movements will become more popular. There will be a
generation of kids who have grown up with phone addicted parents thinking ‘fuck
that’. I do have some hope for the future, I have to or I’d be thoroughly
depressed. 
 
     If gen alpha grows up and takes charge of society and doesn’t change. The world is literally done. My
    little 12 yo sister told me all her classmates talk about is internet brainrot and roblox. One classmate
    told her he only watches a long video once a month. Imagine how fried his brain is… I am still optimistic
    tho…

     i hope there is a new generation. i completely get you on the people who you used to have great
    conversations with. those two years i didnt have a phone i lost contact with people not in my real life
    and when i went back to social media (it was the pandemic), people i never would have expected had become
    massive posters- stories, reels, posts, etc- and they all seem like a regurgitation of each other

     [deleted]

     I pull out my phone in line or offices because I don’t get much reading time at home with a kid so it’s
    5-10 min I get to try to plow through a chapter. But in situations where you’re expected to interact with
    people like dinner or hanging out it’s really frustrating to see people just on their phones. Why are you
    on social media when your social time is happening right in front of you with your actual friends?!

     I hope that the seeds of radical change will be planted in this world. 



 Well-written. I know every generation says this, but I really feel that being
born in the mid-80s was almost perfect. I learned what it meant to use my
imagination and play outside, writing my own stories. I saw the rise of home
gaming consoles, and it sparked a love that led me into my adult career as an
artist and sometimes game developer. When the internet was unleashed, I didn’t
even get to use it in my home until I was about 17 or 18.   Like you, I look
around in public and see how few people are actually in the moment. Everyone has
a screen by them like some sort of futuristic pacifier. So many people are
taking pictures of a pretty moon that looks like shit when you view it in the
gallery, only to post it and have nobody care about it, because everyone is busy
putting on their own performance.   Imagine getting to the end of life and
realizing most of the greatest moments were witnessed through your phone in
front of your face, instead of just looking at the thing itself. Truly gross.

     Yes! Born in the 70s grew up in the 80s here and I miss the day's when we could have heated debates and
    then go have lunch or whatever, not somebody shoving a phone in my face to prove their point. Everything
    is ""gotcha"" moments instead of learning from each other or understanding where a person is coming from,
    even if you disagree. My husband and I went to a park to have a picnic recently, and it was sad seeing the
    majority of people around us looking at their phones instead of enjoying nature and the people they were
    with.

     That last paragraph 🎯

     I am really jealous  I wish I experienced those times but unfortunately I'm only 23 years old. I don't fit
    in this timeline, i hate social media and i value real life connection, but i sometimes feel like an alien
    because i think I'm the only one who thinks like this and everyone's priorities now is just experiencing
    other people's life through a screen rather than wanting to experience it.

     Honestly, the Internet makes people lazier. Because of this, people refuse to tap into their true
    potential. 



 I was at a dinner yesterday with family and my sister told me she no longer
listens to a podcast we both used to like because ""I just don't care any more,
why bother when I could just watch a 30 second tiktok about it instead?"".   I
told her that I've been moving in the other direction and rather than the hour
podcast I've been deep diving Wikipedias and loaning out books from the library,
to which she responded by calling me gay.  Spent the whole time on her phone,
along with her husband and the boomers of the family. The only people not on
phones were 20-40.  We're reverting as a species. 
 
     The idea of calling someone ""gay"" for reading a book is insane on so many multitudes of fronts.  I also
    don't think I've heard someone use ""gay"" as a general pejorative for just like anything they don't
    immediately agree with in a looooong time.  Is this making a come back?  Because that sucks.

     Don't listen to your sister. I support you in your quest to gather more knowledge.



 Back in college, we made a rule that whenever we eat together there would be no
looking at phoneS. And it was brilliant. I think it’s especially harder these
days when everyone is just looking at their phones and wont even speak to you.
The other day me & my husband went out to eat, and then there’s also this
husband and wife who were there but the husband was just on his phone even when
he was eating food. The wife looked at him miserably. Dude at least talk to your
wife!  We have become zombies indeed. It’s going to be hard to break especially
for the kids 
 


 I've also found people are incredibly unfriendly and almost snappy if you do try
and interact with them.  I have younger family members who get incredibly
defensive and agitated if I ask them to be a bit more present - I wonder if they
ever reflect and think they spend too much time on their screens? In general,
those who are totally glued to their phones, I've found, are some of the least
friendly and most 'highly strung' people. I think it has to do with effort and
that it is now exhausting for genuine human interaction. 
 
     It’s because they are addicted and you’re interrupting their dopamine hits



 Phones are like pacifiers keeping us eternal babies 
 


 this is why I’m best friends with a woman that I want to be like. I was losing
my mind and motivation until I met her; now I’m getting rid of my iphone for a
Japanese flip phones I’m getting us in winter. I’ve reconnected with my passions
for singing and writing taking my finances more seriously. It’s a-lot of
building and I’ve only just started, my reward for myself if I pull it all off
is getting us a cat and moving in together. But she already has a pet.  I hate
how much phones demand our attention and notify us constantly about
insignificant things but it’s mixed in with whats important until we don’t even
mind, when it steals away all the time. I’m still learning, sailing on a
makeshift raft basically but I’m happier as a result. If anyone is going through
the same thing we can connect share stories of encouragement. Thank you 
 


 Totally agree. I challenged myself to stay away from social media (Instagram,
Facebook, Tik Tok) for a month to see if I can resist and how it would be to do
that for my mental health, for my time and so on. Basically an experiment on me.
These days, some of my friends are on holiday at the seaside. So random, my
friend send me some pictures with them, the sunset, the beach and so on with the
explanation ""I sent you something to see, if you still don't have Instagram
anymore"".   It felt weird, really, because this was the point - to stay away
from this perfect pictures on social media. I am perfectly fine if I do not see
it. People don't feel ok if they don't show up with their vacation pictures on
social media for everyone to see that they are away, doing something. People are
obsessed with that and this validation seeking. It's crazy how it works. She
basically send me this for validation too, or this is how it felt. I know they
are my friends and I love them, but we live here in the real life and real
world, we can talk about my vacation and your vacation when we see each other. 
 
     oh, thats interesting, i would probably react in a totally opposite way !! i'd be really happy to know
    that the friend remembered i exist and decided to share happy moments with you. showing photos to friends
    was a thing before social media too and i think it just shows that they want to include you in their joy.
    but maybe it wasnt a close friend, in which case that would weird me out.

     ha that's really interesting! you're right tho, why would you care, really? not in a callous way but it
    doesn't really change anything about your life, does it? it does all seem really ego driven to me



 Grew up in the 70s. It was the best. With neighborhood friends we’d lay in the
back of our parents’ trucks at night and just look up at the stars and talk and
tell stories.  Summers we’d walk to the swimming pool or recreation center. We
played in the backyard all day long. As teens we drove around listening to
music, grab a burger, go to the dollar cinemas. We spent time in the most
wonderful simple ways. I wish life went back to those kinds of days. 🥹

How do you limit screen time for kids on YouTube only? Would like them to have like 30 min a day.,"How do you limit screen time for kids on YouTube only? Would like them to have like 30 min a day.

They use the internet for other positive things so don't want to block the
internet.  I can't stand YouTube Kids. Not an option.   Also it would be nice to
block YouTube recomendations.

 Not to be a fear monger but YouTube is not a place for kids anymore. I have been
babysitting my younger cousins (ages 4-12) and the things they are finding on
YouTube are shocking. My aunt doesn’t monitor their internet usage by any means.
The AI garbage is horrible and it’s everywhere. It’s ruining kids attention
spans. I’m only 26 and I grew up on YouTube and watched my fair share of strange
content, but if I had any control over kids today I would remove YouTube
altogether. 
 
     Try channel lab on iOS. It actually blocks ALL recommendations and the algorythm.

     This is the right answer. We have two kids and after a very short attempt at YouTube kids we cut it. The
    shit even other kids will say “do you know XYZ from YouTube” is straight up weird. You can tell which kids
    were babysat by YT all summer and it’s bad.

     I kind of agree. I just spoke with a teacher who has been at it 28 years. She said kids have no ability to
    just be bored. They need to be constantly stimulated. They’re immature, they’re getting dumber. This shit
    is ruining their brains. I fear for them.

     there is youtube kids, it's somewhat better



 Kids should not have unrestricted access to YouTube anymore. 
 
     Agree. But there is sooo much good stuff there!



 Depends on what devices they are accessing YouTube tube on?  My kids have old
iPads so I am able to quite easily control access via the screentime settings,
the app just locks out after a certain amount of time.  My eldest has worked out
he can then transfer to the tv and log in as a guest and it won’t add to his
time but at the moment I haven’t blocked that - feels like he showed a bit of
initiative! 
 


 I know you said you can’t stand YouTube kids, which is valid if you just use it
as is, but you can switch it to Approved Content only. So you can pick which
videos or channels they’re allowed to watch and they can only watch those
things, and it does not recommend anything. No more brainrot (or ads!). And you
can set a time limit on it whereas I don’t think you can do that on regular
YouTube.  
 


 What device are they using?  If it’s on an iPhone or iPad, it’s pretty easy to
use the built in screen time limits for the YouTube app only. This also usually
links to the YouTube website through safari I believe. Just set the limit to 30
mins and use the passcode.   If they use a computer, then you’ll need to look
into some type of browser extension to block the YouTube website itself after a
certain amount of time.   I don’t think there is a way to block YouTube
recommendations as these are on the home page of YouTube. It’s the algorithm. 
 
     They are on ipads. Yea wish I could block recomendations.

 What I would do : use an old laptop, get youtube premium, download videos that
you get to pre approve and then turn the wifi off. The list will auto play and
when its done, it stops. No ads too (although I don't get ads on firefox with
uBlock origin) 
 


 I don't know if you can limit time with this app/browser extension, but you can
remove everything else: comments, recommendations, etc. Even blocks the home
page. [https://unhook.app/](https://unhook.app/) 
 


 You dont wanna use YT Kids and that's fine but at least turn on this setting
then *and* monitor what your children watch.  https://preview.redd.it/dz3ygx6dal

     Also, on ipad you can turn on a timer and have the app automatically stop playing once that time limit has
    been reached. I have my iPad set up like that.

     This doesn’t work all the way. It’s better to go thru and select the videos or channels you approve.



 Kids? How old? If they're young enough that youtube kids is a consideration then
I'd suggest you limit the time by supervising their screen time. 
 


 If you're up for a browser extension vs. the app - Untrap for Youtube AND social
focus together is good. You can do a ton of specifics like no homepage, turn off
recommendations, turn off infinite scroll I think there's over 262 options so I
don't know them all. Worth a try.

Why is it so hard to actually reduce screen time?,"Why is it so hard to actually reduce screen time?

Lately I’ve been really trying to cut down how much time I spend on my phone,
and I keep failing in the dumbest ways.  What’s frustrating is that I know it’s
not good for me, but the urge to pick it up is so automatic. Even when I try to
distract myself or hide my phone, I somehow end up holding it again.  I’m
wondering, for those of you who’ve tried to cut down,  * What’s been the hardest
part for you? * Why do you think it’s so easy to slip back? * Has anything
actually helped long term? * Any practical advice for me that is not ""get a
dumbphone""? (I need my phone to work)  I’m not trying to rant, I’m just really
curious why it’s such a universal struggle. It feels like everyone knows they’re
on their phone too much, but no one does anything to fix it.

 I have a screentime limit with a passcode that only my mom knows. Maybe it
sounds dumb, but it’s super helpful. I don’t plan on it being like this forever,
but for now it’s the only thing that actually reduces my screentime consistently
:) I think your brain needs time to get used to it and less instant dopamine,
that might take months so I’m trying to be patient and also work on mental
health. 
 
     What do you use?

     I actually tried that with a trusted friend. It worked for awhile. Until I had enough and tried to bypass
    it lol. I know, its pathetic. I'm a pretty tech savvy person so I had no problem finding a solution to
    bypass it. Now I'm considering getting a smartwatch that can make calls, WhatsApp, navigation, Google pay
    etc, and keep my smartphone in the car if I really need something a watch can't do. Hope this solves the
    issue probably not though😂



 I feel like getting a dumb phone isn't a great fix. The world we live in is not
the same world we lived in in 2005. I for one don't want to do something
different with regards to communication, that's something I'm already lacking
in, tech aside. Coming from the perspective of someone with an Eating Disorder,
getting a dumb phone is like restricting calories/going on a diet. Your end goal
is reached, but its inorganic and the root of the problem not fixed. 
 


 The hardest part for me so far has been not having immediate answers to my
questions. Is it going to rain, it looks like rain. What time does my son have
to be at practice tomorrow? I actually bought a small memo notebook to keep in
my bag so I can write them down and stop thinking about it.  It's definitely
going to be a journey. Last weekend I went from Saturday at 8pm to Monday
morning without using it. My screen time for last week was about an hour.
Yesterday I used it for 4 hours. Today it's locked in a box and I'm going to try
not to use it until tonight when I need it for football tickets.  We spent years
increasing our dependence on these things and it is going to take time to wean
off. Don't be too hard on yourself.  ETA: I did get a dumb phone. I have a Light
Phone 2 on Mint Mobile ($15/mo) that only my immediate family has the number to.
I take that phone everywhere and leave my iPhone at home because not everyone
who has my number should have immediate access to me. 
 


 The hardest thing for me was replacing my phone with any other things that are
harder.   So for context, this is my current phone setup:  No Face ID, I have a
passcode and I have to physically press the button to turn my phone on.   no
social media except for YouTube and the Reddit app.  I use the browser version
of YouTube in Brave. This allows me to disable YouTube shorts. My phone is in
black and white. All of this helped to cut my screen time down from 11hrs to
4hrs.  I think it’s so easy to slip back for me because I’m unemployed and I use
my phone as a substitute for human connection. I mainly watch long videos of
people talking about the attention economy (ironically), psychology, philosophy.
It allows me to think deeply about things because I’m so bored during my usual
day to day.   The things I did helped long term. Oh, I also have a physical
alarm clock! That was the best thing I’ve bought so far. It’s a children’s alarm
clock. The light slowly turns on over 10 minutes and then it goes off. I have to
get up and press a button to turn it off.   Practical advice would be to
surround yourself with people. Connect with other human beings. Make sure you’re
introspective. If you slip up one day, take a look back and ask yourself what
exactly happened? How can it be prevented next time? 
 
     Didn't know about that version of YouTube. Lately I've just been bored of YouTube though tbf so I've been
    going on less



 The fact of the matter is that it's harder to do because it's a habit we've been
conditioned to set up. You train your brain, ""Oh, I want stimulation,"" so you
provide it. You Pavlov yourself with the notification noises. So on and so
forth.  For me, it was easiest to transition by offloading everything that can
be done to a secondary device, to be moved there. My main phone is primarily for
texting, calls, GPS, financial apps / mobile wallet, Discord (how my roommates
communicate), ordering apps (McDonalds, etc...), and Dasher if I want to make a
quick buck. The latter includes a mileage tracking app and Numbers for
spreadsheets so I can write down my odometer information.  So if I want to check
Reddit, Facebook, etc..., I have to use my computer. 
 


 I think it's easy to slip back because, to some extent, a smartphone is really
useful for quick communication. Once you’ve completed the communication part,
the distractions are there like reading the news or checking social media and
before you know it, another 30 minutes have just passed. I also think the red
notification alert makes it more tempting to check what’s happening on the apps
you use.  What helped me in the past (though it takes real commitment to
persevere) was to completely turn off my phone once I was done checking it. I
noticed that I would automatically grab my phone and try to turn it on to check
social media again. Once you consistently turn off your phone completely, you
notice in the beginning a kind of error in your brain, like something is wrong,
and then realize, “Oh yeah, I turned off my phone completely.”  Those are the
moments to reflect and ask yourself, “Do I really need to check it?” Most of the
time, the answer is no it’s just not worth waiting for your phone to turn on to
do whatever you intended to do on it. 
 


 ive never had an issue with the phone but for me its my laptop  the main problem
is just the habit of wanting stimulation and then having a bunch of options to
scroll through  i trim back all my subs and autodelete history so algos cant
keep recommending new stuff  now when i go online i might watch a video or 2 and
browse through reddit a bit but my feed is very short and boring so i dont
really have a need to get back and check it multiple times a day  as an addict
you have to trim back what you can, go without for as long as possible but
realise you wont just fix the problem instantly you might go from 4hrs a day to
2hrs for a bit before ending back at 3hrs or so  the main thing is just
awareness of how the sites suck you in and your mind just gets stuck in habit
loops 
 


 my hardest time is at work, i have a lot of down time so i find myself
scrolling. a friend introduced me to this thing called Brick. It comes with an
app and a physical thing you tap the phone too, it shuts off whatever apps you
tell it to. So i block all social media when i have it in brick mode, and the
only way to unbrick is to tap it again, so i leave the brick at home and then
those apps are locked all day. 
 


 When I 'need' my phone for something quick (looking something up, ...), but
don't want to get sucked into scrolling, I use my phone standing up. No
scrolling for 2 hours by accident when I'm not sitting/lying down. 
 


 Phones are designed to be addicting and we help that out by centering all our
lives around the screen. It is convenient. I already carry my phone, so why not
make it my day planner, grocery list, to do list, etc? I started carrying a
notebook like it was still 2005 and now I am far less addicted. I have to carry
an extra thing. But checking my grocery list in my notebook never leads to
mindless scrolling. I keep the sound off on my phone for everything but calls as
well, which further reduces the temptation.

Help me to reduce my screen time to maximum 1 hour,"Help me to reduce my screen time to maximum 1 hour

I'm heavily addicted to YouTube. Even though some of it is going to study
purposes, 60% is going for mindless skits and videos.   Also reddit doom-
scrolling is becoming a huge problem.   If anyone could help like how do I stop
myself from exceeding that 1 hour mark, it will be so good.

 Cutting from 6h to 1h is tough but doable with the right structure. YouTube is
the big one here. Either delete the app or block it until you've done something
productive. I use the Jomo app to set a rule like ""no YouTube until I’ve read 20
minutes"". That tiny friction helps a ton.  Reddit’s another trap. Limit it to
one time slot per day or use Jomo’s scheduled sessions to block it outside that
window.  Grayscale + Do Not Disturb during the day also helps kill mindless
scrolling vibes. And don’t just try to ""do nothing"", have a go-to replacement
habit ready, even something small like reading, walking, or journaling.

     The password is a good idea!

     I installed the app but the option to block the explorer page doesn't show 😭



 Disable YouTube history. It removes the home page and Shorts tab This way, you
will only be delivered videos from subscribed channels.Unsubscribe from some
that are not relevant too 
 


 Get rid of the chat gpt first 
 


 Block youtube and reddit on your phone and if you REALLY need to use it to study
or something, you can open it on a computer or in a public library, if you dont
have a computer. 
 
     This is the way and exactly how I got myself to 1 hour or less per day. Delete the social apps, access
    only on the computer, and, even then, make it such that the computer is a stationary object and a place;
    it does not move from the desk. Log out after every use of social media. Do research of your own and dig
    into books and the library instead of using ChatGPT.



 Get angry at the stupid phone use.  Remember that life is quite short actually,
use your time wisely.  
 


 I used to scroll for like 9 hours a day a year ago. My biggest problem was also
YT.   You’re reaching out for help which is great man, I didn’t do that.   But I
did eventually learn how to reduce my screen time. First to around 4-5 hours
then eventually to where I am now, 30-45 mins a day. No Youtube or Reddit doom
scrolling anymore.  I was stuck scrolling like you for most of my life I
suppose. I eventually realised from watching a video on YouTube (ironic, I know)
that I would be so much better off in everything I was pursuing in my life if I
cut out the constant consumption. Even if it was “educational”. I decided to go
full cold turkey. I deleted YouTube from my phone and anything else I scrolled
on.   Next I wrote down some rules. My Dopamine Detox rules. These included:  -
no binging YouTube or content consumption - no binging music  - no scrolling  -
no web surfing    There were others but that was the gist. Then I set up a
streak on I Am Sober (app on iPhone) to count how long I was able to follow
these rules.   It was hard. The first 24 hours were spent in this sort of grey
fog. But it got better quite quickly. Then by day 3 I noticed a huge difference
in motivation! I was actually excited to do things. Even boring chores didn’t
need YouTube videos in the background. It’s been one of the biggest positive
changes in my life without a doubt. I’ve never had so much motivation and, also,
so little anxiety before. I’m so glad I did it, and I will continue to do so and
improve upon it going forwards.   I basically don’t consume social media
anymore. I do watch some content but not everyday.   There are a few other
things I do that are really helpful:   1. Check my screen time a few times a
week to ensure it’s not too high. This keeps me in the loop about my behaviours
2. Every week see which apps I spend the most time on and think of a way to move
these behaviours from my phone to my laptop (I think laptops are WAY less
addictive than phones so I don’t mind doing things on there instead) or just
stop using the apps altogether   3. I keep my phone on a shelf where I can’t see
it all day (I WFH). I have no notifications on except phone calls.
Importantly, I got a LOT of time back after quitting these behaviours. It was
crucial I filled my time up to ensure there was no “dead time” where I could be
tempted to scroll. I use time-blocking and Google Calendar to fill my day up
with things to do. I’m either working towards my goals or enjoying myself with
fun hobbies or spending time with friends/family. Life’s a lot better now.   I
hope this helps!

 You've got this, while it will be hard at first I would focus on decreasing the
YouTube use because that will have the most impact. Perhaps you can decrease
from 4.5 to 4 hours the first day and continue to decrease by 15, 20 or 30
minutes. Do you have something you would like to replace that time with? For
example, reading, learning a language, sudoku or crossword puzzles? Exercising?
Walking?   Then, for the Reddit doom-scrolling, perhaps you could only have
feeds that bring you joy and are useful. I now only use Reddit on my computer
and try to check no more than 1x per day - eventually 5-6x a week is my goal!
Good luck - you will be able to have an impact!! 
 


 Obviously the sinolest solution is delete youtube and only use it on a computer.
I would go one further. Youtube is a finely tuned drug. Im willing to bet those
""skits"" you are watching you are not searching for and are simply being
rwcommended to you. I would strongly consider creating a new google account for
the sole purpose of watching only school things. Do not ever watch personal
thing on this account. There will be no algorithim to use to customize the drug
they serve you. The recomemnds will only look like click bait BS, and unless you
have some mental disability, will be easy to avoid. 
 
     Yes I have done that



 Delete the apps. Try a week. You just need to break out of the habit of
scrolling on your phone. Deleting the app helps you to do something else instead
of clicking on the app whenever you’re bored.

Reducing screen time won't solve your problems,"Reducing screen time won't solve your problems

# The unsatisfying truth  Screen time it's not the problem in itself. And I
realised this too recently, last week when I went alone to Barcelona for a one
week trip. Everyday was the same and I had a screen time of around 10 hours per
day. Which is quite big (compared to school weeks when my screen time is less
than 3h per day). But it has been the best week since a long time. Why is that ?
Because I spent that screen time on things I really enjoyed and kept working,
working out and having outsides activities at the same time. Screen wasn't a
blind for my life, it was an extender. What is was supposed to be at the very
beginning.  This is just to let you know that screen time in itself is not a
really good metric, if you happened to work (deep work) on your computer it
still count's as screen time.  # My situation  The apps/websites I am addicted
to:  * Youtube * Reddit * Linkedin * Jellyfin (self-hosted netflix)  # How the
situation is evolving  I signed out (without deleting my accounts) of Reddit and
Linkedin and it has been quite efficient (tested only one day for the moment).
Youtube is still the main problem, I have asked youtube to delete all my
history, likes, subscriptions and to not get my data anymore so now I don't have
a home screen. I have two extensions to remove recommendations, comments,
shorts, thumbnails anything distracting. But I was still addicted to youtube
through the trending page, and that was the main problem since I still spent a
lot of time on youtube but in the end it was on content I didn't enjoy because
it wasn't curated for me.  # The miracle  One day, without prior announcement,
the trending page was gone, I checked if it was my chrome extensions but it
wasn't. Youtube deleted the trending page. So now I cannot be addicted to
Youtube anymore right?  **Wrong!** I am still spending way too much hours on
Youtube. Now I have to consciously search for a channel or a specific video I
want to watch. I previously thought that only having a search bar for youtube
would be enough, because the effort required for my brain to find a video to
watch would be bigger than the potential reward. But no.   My conclusion on this
is the following, **you might try to optimise your devices to get the least
amount of distractions as possible, that won't solve the problem** in itself.
The most basic still underrated advice on breaking from the screen addiction is
to busy ourselves with something else that we enjoy. I am not in the endeavour
of reducing my screen time for the sake of it. But in a search for happiness and
I think screens have a role in this endeavour. Screens are a barrier for me in
reaching this goal, but breaking the barrier doesn't mean I cross immediately
across it, I still need the interior motivation to progress forward, but
reducing screens will free me time to find this motivation.

 Giving people condescending advice about the ineffectiveness of reducing screen
time while spending 10 hours PER DAY on your phone while on holiday? Audacious. 
 
     now, when you say it



 Screens just piss me off personally. They make me look even though I don't want
to, it's kind of like when you're driving and feel the need to stare into other
cars lights. It's bright and there's nothing else of interest to look at
Waiting for the elevator, in a grocery store queue, doctor's office, walking
outside.. I never get the chance to breathe    So I guess I agree with you that
reducing screentime doesn't ""solve"" anything. But for me personally I feel a lot
more energetic when I don't bring a smartphone along every day 
 
     I agree with you, my take is that smarphone / computers replace the time you had before to think on your
    situation and try to fix it. But stopping screens isn't a magic bullet



 Reducing screen time frees up a lot of extra time to pursue other real world
things 🤗 like a walk in the park, reading a book etc. your brain will thank you
for it 🧠for example, I feel less frazzled and not so brain-fried 
 
     I see lots of people walking in the park glued to their phones:) 



 Hard disagree. Reducing screen time will dramatically improve your mental health
and give you much more free time. What I will say is, you need to fill that new
free time with meaningful hobbies and creative output, otherwise you will just
lapse. 
 


 It’s more the socially manipulative behaviour modification algorithms that cause
existential problems to us as a species that can identify what is reality and
what isnt that worries me, not kids spending a few hours playing angry birds or
watching netflix each day 
 


 I definitely agree that screen time, like all sorts of compulsive behavior, is
symptom of a greater issue.   > The most basic still underrated advice on
breaking from the screen addiction is to busy ourselves with something else that
we enjoy.  This is what really gets me. My screen time skyrockets during work
hours, but when I'm not working or it's the weekend my desire to check my phone
goes way down. Although I'm in a bit of a defeatist mindset right now in that I
feel like I'll always be miserable at work and in my career in general until I
retire, which means tons of compulsive phone usage during work hours. Been
working with a therapist on this, but it's taking a long while to figure out the
issues and how to deal with them. 
 
     It reminds me of the cattle abusing opioids during the Vietnam War.  Researches found that cattle would
    graze on poppies (opioids) during stressful times: during heavy artillery strikes, loud noises,
    disruptions in their daily life, etc.  When the war stopped, the cattle stopped eating the poppies because
    the stressor wasn’t there.  I feel like living in a developed country during the 21st century has
    implemented so much unnecessary stress in our lives, but we’ve gotta eat.

     As someone scrolling on Reddit right now as a ""break"" from my current writing task at my Work from Home
    job, I'm with you there. I use my phone way more during work hours because I can afford to at home without
    being caught, and because I keep wanting to step away from it. Even when I physically try to keep my phone
    away Infind myself checking, maybe to chat a friend or just... open Reddit, under the guise something
    ""important"" will come up.



 Nor will going to Italy. 
 
     Barcelona is in Spain but yes



 For the vast majority of people, they can't even do anything because they're
completely addicted to screen time. They give up all the motivation and desire
to do something there, whether on television or on their cell phone. So yes, the
recommendation is to reduce screen time, as well as get vaccinated. 
 
     Sorry, but the title, while a call to action, isn't helpful. It's like saying, ""Quitting drinking won't
    solve your problems."" But first, you have to stop drinking.



 Addicted to LinkedIn? Pardon, I know there's a social aspect to it, but that's
nutty to me. Addicted to resumés 
 
     Maybe addicted is a bit too much, but when I'm really really bored, I don't have any feed except
    linkeding, so I scroll during 5+ minutes



 I don’t think doing enjoyable things is the solution because many tasks are
necessary that aren’t enjoyable. You need to be the director of your own
attention, not some app.

What was the motivator behind you wanting to reduce your screen time?,"What was the motivator behind you wanting to reduce your screen time?

I mean something like a breakthrough moment or a sudden realization that you
were wasting your life on a screen.  For me it was this latter one :)  I'm
asking because I'm trying to convince my friends, but it seems like I haven't
been able to make a strong enough impact to inspire any change.

 I only have so little time on this planet. mindless consumption on meaningless
stuff does not add any value to my life, it only creates more problems, e.g. a
more anxious and restless mind due to the overload of information and endless
amount of mind polluting content out there in the digital space 
 


 My reason might be a little lame lol, but i realized how much time i was wasting
when i started having a crush on a guy and realized that all the cool things
that i liked about him were related to how he spent his time. He had taught
himself cool skills, played instruments, was learning his 3rd language, read
interesting books... and when i looked at my life i felt embarrased because i
finally realized i spent my time in mindless, worthless consumption.  Nothing
ever happened with this guy and we don't even talk anymore, but that silly
little crush made me have an epiphany and begin to change the way i lived.  I
think that if you're looking to convince your friends of reducing their screen
time, maybe showing them how you use your time can be an inspiration. Also,
straight up\* telling them to think about everything they could have achieved by
now if they didnt self sabotage like that could also work, depending on their
personalities ofc. I feel like it makes for a fuller life 
 
     I feel the same way. I’m attracted to those kind of people so I wanna become someone like that, otherwise
    I will never attract that type of person. That being said… my motivation was never a person lol. But my
    dry eyes making it hard for me to look at screens much 😭



 Anxiety 
 


 It physically hurts my head. That made me quit cold turkey. 
 


 “Social Dilemma” on Netflix started literally everything. 
 


 Severe nerve pain in my right hand, pointer finger and all the way up into my
brachial plexus (basically my entire shoulder) from hyper mobility and chronic
Lyme disease that is majorly exacerbated by holding and touching my phone (and
other screens).   I majorly cut my my phone use over a year ago and I had the
first winter in 3 years without crippling pain!   Sadly I still have the nerve
pain, and can hardly work on a computer, which sucks because I need to work, but
it is much better.   Also finding a good PT helped. But quitting scrolling
really helped. 
 
     Omg I think i have that. I literally have a doctor's appointment next week for this ongoing shoulder pain
    that I've suspected came from scrolling.



 Having kids has been a huge motivator, though I’d been noticing the negative
impact social media was having on me before they came along and I’d been through
seasons of deleting/deactivating accounts for years.   I still scroll in front
of my kids and I’m not perfect but I’m much better than I was before they came
along and my presence online is much smaller now! 
 


 One day I reached my phone to open Tiktok. The thought occurred to me that for
all the time I had spent on it the day before, I could only remember a handful
of videos.   I decided the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Lent was coming up
and I decided to give it up.   Now I'm starting to go down an online privacy
rabbit hole and that's motivating a renewed interest in keeping my time online
to a minimum. 
 


 I just felt physically sick and exhausted every time I used my phone for even a
little while. I hated how my head hurt and my eyes hurt and how I would go to
open one app and open every app on my phone except the one I wanted.   It was a
slow process, but I only use 3 platforms (Facebook, Reddit and YouTube) on my
laptop now, and not for long.   The problem, for me, was short form content
being too overstimulating. It wires me up and makes me awake. 
 


 I started to realize I was so full of rage when scrolling social media. Just
furious about things. I decided to scale way back. Then I realized I have the
attention span of a gnat. I can’t even sit and watch tv. I have to be doing
something. So I got an iPad and put no socials on it. I do art and play games
and read magazines. It’s not less screen time but it is a shift toward it. It’s
definitely improved my mental health. AI is another huge reason. I refuse to
live my life questioning if what I’m seeing or reading was created by a real
human using real humans. It’s just a place I’m not willing to exist in. So
getting off socials is essential. I do not use Reddit the same way and the
algorithm is so “safe” here that I don’t over use it or whatnot.

Results after a year of cutting down on screen time!,"Results after a year of cutting down on screen time!

I've been seriously cutting down on screen time since April 2024. In April of
2024, my phone screen time regularly reached 6.5 hours a day, and that's not
including time I spent on the computer or watching TV.  Now my phone screen time
averages around 2 hours. That's a difference of 4.5 hours. My top used apps are
Google Maps, Finch (self help app) and iMessage instead of social media. I've
spent less time on my computer, too.  What Tactics Didn't Work:   Guilt-tripping
myself, ""willpower"", watching videos about conquering digital addiction. Apps
like Opal, Freedom, etc.  What Tactics Did Work:  Other Blocking apps-I make
myself wait 30 seconds before I can use ""time-wasting"" apps and then limit my
use to 3-5 minutes. Willpower alone doesn't work, but making it so you have to
wait to use apps really evaporates the habit of staying on them compulsively (I
recommend ScreenZen on phone; StayFocusd on computer--both are free/very
customizable).  Meditation-I joined a meditation group and now meditate for 10
minutes most days. It was excruciating at first but now helps me be able to
enjoy being bored and engaging in tasks that are rewarding but kind of tedious
(like cleaning, cooking, etc.) It also helped me feel more optimistic and
forgive myself and others more easily.  DBT Workbook & joining a free group
therapy on executive functioning/focus  Things I've noticed over the last year:
I engage in less compulsive behavior, and it's more tolerable to be ""bored"" on
long car and plane rides. I don't mind just looking around the room and can
listen in conversations even if I'm not interested. I'm able to focus more at
work. It's easier to clean my room. I feel a lot less emotionally reactive. Like
I'm able to recognize my bad emotions in the moment and kind of assess if I want
to pursue them. My relationships with my partner and family improved. The amount
of books I've read vastly increased (went from 5 books a year to like 50). I'm
able to read things I'm not interested in and still pay attention; sometimes I
realize that the boring things I'm reading for class are actually interesting
later on. I started a garden. I'm slightly better at remembering appointments. I
shop online way less. I'm less anxious to do community activities like hanging
out at the LGBT center or hanging out with my girlfriend's friends.  I'm not
sure if this is all because of screen time. These are just the things I've
noticed.  I can no longer mentally process short-form content like Youtube
shorts or Tiktok without getting tired fast (I no longer have these apps, but
sometimes my friends show me). I don't like watching long-form video essays or
podcasts on Youtube unless they're really interesting to me  Even though the
world has noticeably gotten worse over the last year, I feel more optimistic
than I did previously. I work in a newsroom now too, and am STILL more
optimistic. I don't think it's consuming news that's the problem---but only
reading algorithmically-delivered news on social media naturally gave me only
negative things to read, and the comment sections were filled with people who
had no hope for the future.  All this to say that I had a good experience
cutting down on screen time. I feel more engaged with the world in general. I'm
happier here. A lot of rewarding things require patience, and less screen time
makes it easier to be patient. I think that a lot of things that have made me
happy are things I found by total accident while being bored...like cool books
while wandering the stacks at the library or the little hairs on a squash leaf.
And sometimes I get cool ideas when I'm just looking around a room or walking
outside.  I still have a long way to go, but, overall, I'm happy about the
progress I've made. I know a lot of people here are just beginning their
journeys, so, if anyone has any questions they want to ask, I'm happy to answer
them.

 Why didn’t opal work? 
 
     I found it to be gimmicky and cost money; it works as a screen time blocker but it also keeps the user
    spending time on their app. There are better free options imo



 what meditation group did you join? 
 
     It was one at my school!



 Thank you for sharing. 💕 
 


 Amazing progress!! 
 


 What’s your finch name? I’m on there as well!!! 
 
     I'll DM you!



 You should be proud of you, mate. 
 


 I also use ScreenZen and it helped me a lot! 
 


 Thank you for sharing. I started my process, and is very helpful read about
other experiences. I’m trying meditation every day, removed my social media
(except Reddit) and focus in the things that really is important for a good life 
 


 This was such a refreshing read - love seeing real stories like this 🙌  I went
through something similar last year. My wife and I were both getting stuck in
that endless scroll loop, and the guilt part was the worst. I actually ended up
building a small screen time app called Hazel to make the process feel less
judgmental and more about gentle awareness instead of restriction.  Your post
reminded me why I started it in the first place - it’s wild how much calmer life
gets once you’re not constantly refreshing feeds. Thanks for sharing your
experience!

Struggling with 10+ hours of screen time — how do you actually break free?,"Struggling with 10+ hours of screen time — how do you actually break free?

I recently realized my daily screen time is over 10 hours. It feels like I’m
unlocking my phone and scrolling almost automatically, without even noticing.
I’ve tried different blocking apps, but most of them just focus on restriction.
They don’t really give me a sense of motivation or support — just walls that I
eventually find a way around.  I’m curious:  * Has anyone found an app or method
that actually helps build self-control rather than just locking you out? * For
those who’ve managed to cut down, what worked for you? * And for people like me,
who *want* to change but keep failing… what do you think is the biggest reason
behind those failures?  I’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve gone
through this.

 All the tactics in the world will not make a meaningful difference until you're
convicted on a philosophical level. ""Yeah, I know I'm wasting my life away...""
is very different than ""Hellllll no, I have a bunch I want to do in this
lifetime and this little black box is stealing those opportunities from me, no
more!""  People get their philosophical conviction from different places. The Cal
Newport Digital Minimalism book did nothing for me, even though I like some of
the concepts (ie: is this technology the best way to achieve the thing i need
done?)    Mine came from 1) Reading The Sirens Call by Chirs Hayes about
attention. There is a line in there akin to ""They are taking your attention for
their benefit."" I was like fuuuuuuucccckkk no, Zuckerberg and these other tech
titans aren't going to steal from me anymore. It wasn't new information to me,
but something about how the book laid it out flipped a switch in me. You'll have
to find what flips a switch.  2) I went and built a whole giant list of more
interesting things I sincerely want to do. Not things I think I should do, not
things I wish I wanted to do. Actually want to do. Turns out, if you put off
stuff long enough, it's possible you just don't want to do it.... and then the
scroll becomes more appealing. For me, I found this list through the process in
The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron. Polarizing book, seems like people love or
hate it, but it was life-changing for me. It hit at exactly the right time,
after I'd become convicted to take my attention and creative force back from
tech. A big part was I had to start paying attention to what actually sparked
some enjoyment, flow, curiosity in me - that wasn't on a screen.   The answers
at times were surprising: taking apart things, mental maps, deep cleaning
things, making notebooks and stickers, breathwork and soundbaths, hosting more
in person social get togethers, etc etc. The big deal was noticing and tracking
those little sparks of enjoyment and then puzzling through what other activities
have those features. Look up Tara Mohr's Core Nutrients article/exercise for a
shortcut to find some elements of what lights you up.   And then yes, tactics
and techniques become important after that. I do use a screen time blocker
(AppBlock) because I can go down an excessive rabbit hole on a few sites that I
just need blocked. Putting my phone out of my bedroom so I dont touch it for at
least the first hour of my day (most days, not perfect) is critical to me - I
started thinking of my phone as a menace that threatens my creativity. I had to
create easy ways to do things without my phone (like keeping a small notebook on
me to jot down to-dos and things I want to tell people or add to my calendar),
because I also would get sucked in if I opened my phone to do something
legitimate. I started using my laptop for more stuff (including texting) because
for me, it isn't as much of a hole as the phone. I took the little finger loop
off my phone case and sometimes purposely wear clothes without pockets so it is
less convenient to keep my phone on me. I signed up for a once a week news
summary and stopped reading the news beyond that (seemed impossible, I am in
charge of some things at work related to actions of people in the news, but it
is amazing how what you need to know still finds you and ignorance seriously is
bliss). But none of that works without the conviction and the list of things I
truly want to do with my time/attention. 
 
     Wow, what an incredible and thoughtful response. I’m not OP but appreciate all the reccomendations here. I
    also LOVE tinkering and taking things apart and deep cleaning 🤩

     Really appreciate you sharing such a vivid personal experience. It’s super helpful to hear what actually
    made a difference for you.



 Handover your phone to someone outside and just deal with the withdrawal somehow
by sleeping, reading books, hobbies, exercises etc. it doesn't matter but
initially make a goal of being phone free for like a month. You will feel bored
and maybe sleep more but trust me with time your mind and body will adjust to it
and then you will slowly start feeling good and will find new interesting things
that are good for you to do. Its like going to a rehab for heroin or any drug
addiction except it is normalized, legal, less understood and a silent killer. 
 
     I'll try, thank you!



 I went cold turkey, i deactivated my IG and it’s been one year, and started
playing sudoku and reading books again. 
 


 I struggle with my screen time as much as you do. I tried everything: screen
time apps, dumbphone, leaving my phone locked away in a far place, et cetera.
Nothing worked.  After having discovered the causes of my phone addiction, my
screentime has gone down considerably. I used the numbing effect of scrolling to
escape from anxiety from work, boredom in my life (and dysthemia) and not
dealing with problems. I now try to improve my life every day. And I have
created personal (fun) projects to do. The need for mindless scrolling has gone
down from 8+ hours to less than an hour without putting down restrictions.  My
advise to you would be to look within and find the root cause of your phone use. 
 


 I will start from the bottom:   The biggest reason you fail is because social
media/youtube/the internet in general is a self-nurturing vicious cycle, there's
no way of leaving it without a certain degree of a cold turkey approach. It is
something MADE for you to be addicted to, so technology is something that you
will always want to be a bit cautious while using it.  I've struggled a lot with
that but I think I've finally found the method that works for me:   1. My life
is mainly without internet, social media, or anything of that sort.  2. If I
have to use the internet, I will specify what I want to do, do it and get out of
it, I don't just ""hang out"" in the internet, I use it intentionally.  3. You'll
learn it by mistakes, and you will commit mistakes (this week I downloaded
instagram to follow someone from my uni and endend up being 3h in Instagram, so
that's not happening again).      But we have to get one thing straight:
Internet use is not fun. There are fun things in the internet, for sure, but it
is not worth it at all when you leave it and you realize how much real life has
to offer.  If you leave the internet you will be bored, the solution to that is
simple: Find things to do. 
 
     I totally agree with this. I used to just cut everything off and feel amazing, but lately I thought, what
    if I try to control my usage and have a healthy relationship with my phone? It just doesn’t work. The way
    these apps are designed, you end up addicted again



 what i'm trying to do right now is to track how i feel when i overuse my phone.
and for the first few days it really helped me. i felt more conscious about the
time spent on the phone, and i was controlling myself better. nonetheless, after
few days i got used to and kind of came back to my habits, but what's important
- i started to better identify patterns of my behvior which i think might help
in the future.  i ask myself these 3 questions everyday (set up an alarm for
10am, 2pm and 9pm):  1/ how anxious am I?  very anxious (on a scale from 1 to 7)
very calm  2/ how strong was my urge to check the phone in the last hour?  no
urge at all (1 - 7) impossible to resist  3/ how do i feel?  very low (1 - 7)
very upbeat/excited     if you want, try it for a few days, maybe it will unlock
some insight that will help you later - i already have some thoughts that might
be useful in my own situation  good luck 
 


 I deleted TikTok, instagram, and Facebook a couple months ago. Without being
able to scroll endlessly, my phone lost the appeal (addiction). There’s nothing
I’m actually missing on there that I can’t find out via texting with friends,
the news, or Reddit. Honestly it (social media) is all just a giant waste of
time.   What I use my phone for now is Amazon, transactional things (buying
tickets and paying for parking), and playing games (NYT $5/month). Other than
that my phone gets boring and I end up picking up a book or doing literally
anything else.   It’s OK to not the “in the know” with all those people, celebs,
and creators because you’re IRL in the know with the actual people in your life.
I don’t miss it. At all. I’m so happy to not be a part of that world anymore. 
 


 I have had to absolutely convince, bribe and FORCE myself to do the things i
actually want to be doing so that my brain can remember how much i love doing
those things. I love reading, playing video games, yoga and working out. I have
to cook, clean, work a day job. There are things im trying to learn so im taking
classes. I want to remember how to think.   Its not as much about having
something else to do every moment of the day (i will get oppositional against my
own decisions, but having the logical and ingrained KNOWING that if im bored and
want to scroll- it will feel much nicer after a good stretch. Better yet, a
little exercise- it can be VERY little like kind of dancing to a song or doing
like 3 exercises, then a stretch or yoga pose, maybe meditation if im in “im a
healthy human” mode by then. Or journal or do some art or call a loved one.
Maybe i remember in the quiet time that i was enjoying that book or i feel ready
to take on that one boss again, or solve a problem or maybe im ready to grab a
drink and scroll Reddit after all…  Making myself do the things i love reminds
me why i love them and makes them a more accessible default. Stretching feels
amazing. I feel better afterward. When i dont do it, i get antsy and want to do
it.   Treating scrolling like an activity reminds me why it is so garbage. In an
hour of scrolling there are maybe a few moments of enjoyment, some moments of
anger or other emotion, etc. Then theres fear, anger, stress, confusion that
linger. Poor sleep, etc.   In an hour i can do SO many things. Or in the blink
of an eye when scrolling i can realize an hour has elapsed and then look down
and realize i did it again.   There are no apps, locks, alarms, purchases or
anything else that do job. Self reflection  and knowing my values and who i want
to be as a person and really looking at what i can do vs. what i actually do in
a day is everything. Looking at relaxations as well, for me, relaxing isn’t
usually passive. Scrolling doesn’t FEEL passive, theres slight movement, theres
thoughts, but doing puzzles, coloring, journaling, or sitting quietly with or
without the kind of company that feels energizing or comfortable or safe is WAY
better. I get to decide how i want to feel, how hard i want to think, and not
consume the crap of people  i don’t know, don’t like and usually don’t even
believe.   To me, all minimalism is in service of being who i want to be while
taking maximum pleasure from the things that i do for pleasure. It gets easier
and my life keeps getting better. I am simply curating my own lifestyle where i
do not have to choose from a catalogue that someone else designed. Its not a
‘core’ and no one activity is my whole personality. It is my life and i, trying
to live it well. And in many days, that excludes mindless scrolling. Mindless
doodling, journalling, strolling or making things up is much more fulfilling.
Once you’re past the part where the knowledge is all logical (like knowing that
poor sleep affects performance) and into the part where you really truly feel it
(like getting good sleep for a week and everything is just better and its not
even hard to do) it starts to click and its insanely liberating. 
 
     Thank you so much for your genuine advice, it really means a lot to me.



 I built an app called Monkeyless. It's exactly how you're describing it. Instead
of focusing on the phone, it focuses on fostering mindfulness.  Would love to
give you free access, we have around 10k users a humble start with many, many

     I want to do this but I have no idea where to start. Any advice? I have some land next to my house that I
    own but it’s nothing but trees and weeds.

on my balcony and staring at trees. It's been life-changing. I don't even think
of the phone anymore, it feels quite meaningless. 
 


 I downloaded App Blocker and had a really good stretch where I was at like 1
hour a day of screen time.   I was reading a ton more, playing ps5, got into 3d

going through radiation rn and I undid my App Blocker settings for now. 
 
     So sorry you are going through radiation

app and an app that gives me a daily crossword & a couple other quick puzzles. I
guess my main goal is to not do so much social media. That’s where I get sucked
in, lose time, and feel worse. Reddit seems to be okay for me out of all social

Is Brick App legit or just another screen time gimmick?,"Is Brick App legit or just another screen time gimmick?

I’ve seen Brick App mentioned a few times now, it’s supposed to help you stop
mindless phone use by making the unlock process slower? Sounds interesting, but
also like something I’d download, use twice, then forget about.  I tried
searching but most of the stuff that comes up feels like promo material. I’m
looking for real experiences. Did it actually help you use your phone less? Or
did it just end up being another thing to swipe past?  Would love honest
thoughts especially if you’ve tried it for more than a few days.

 I've been using it since October 1st. Screen time went from 7+ hours to under 2
hours a day. Like anything else, you have to WANT to do it for it to be
successful, but like others said, it really helps with late night/middle of the
night/early morning scrolling if you have to go to another part of your house to
""unbrick"" your phone. Most days I am ""bricked"" for 23+ hours. 
 
     > Most days I am “bricked” for 23+ hours  That’s called priapism — you should see a doctor

     Can you not just revoke its screentime permissions? I discovered that with Bloom and it has made the whole
    thing basically pointless :(



 the difference is the physical unlocking aspect. you need to go tap your phone
on it to unlock it. my girlfriend used it for a while, she kept it in the
kitchen and would brick it when she got home from work. if she wanted to use her
phone, she would go unbrick it in the kitchen and brick it when she was done
(almost like a smart phone when she left the house and then a landline when she
was home) no one wants to doomscroll while standing in the kitchen. it worked
for her! I will say the physical brick device is very expensive & there are a
few cheaper alternatives. Another issue is the fact that you have to rebrick it
yourself everytime you unbrick it. If there were a timer or something I think
that’d be better but you need the willpower to choose to brick your phone. in my
case it made it no more effective than the freedom app or smth similar 
 


 especially good at night when i usually spiral into scroll mode. 
 


 I have tried a handful of apps and I do like Brick. I love to stay sitting down
once I’m comfy, so brick is a good option for me both at work and at home lol.
Like, if I ask myself, “is it worth it to get out from under this warm blanket
and go all the way to the kitchen just to look at an app that I don’t even want
to be looking at anyway” most of the time the answer for me is “nah” lol.   I
have a strict setting and a less-strict setting. At home I can be more strict
because it’s easier to unbrick at home, so no worries about being locked out of
something I might need, but at work the list of apps I am locked out of is
focused on just my worst offenders that I will never need during the work day.
FWIW, even though I do use Brick, I also use Forest which is like a mildly
gamefied pomodoro timer app. It scolds me if I pick up my phone at all while the
timer is running but doesn’t lock me out of anything. So Brick keeps me locked
out of Reddit and Instagram all day, and Forest scolds me if I look at my phone
during a focus block. 
 


 https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/search/?q=Brick 
 


 I just wish I could use it to brick my phone once I'm already in bed without
tapping it while I was still getting into the habit of using it! And only use it
to un-brick it physically. 
 
     Im pretty sure i read that you can . you long press the app button 'brick' for 15 seconds and its the same
    as tapping it against your brick? no>



 I have the same question bc I think the physical device aspect would help but I
want to research more. I'm taking a UX class where I get run my own mini
project, so I decided to create a survey about Brick. I've since expanded it to
ask abt digital detox methods in general (brick, bloom, screen time settings,
forest) and I'm looking for people that want to give their thoughts.   If you're
able, I'd appreciate you taking my
[survey](https://uchicago.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_82Flnx8xwh9hhc2) :) 
 


 I’ve been using Brick for a few weeks and it’s legit. It’s super simple, no
tracking or complicated setup but that tiny pause before unlocking really makes
you think about why you’re reaching for your phone. Way easier to stick with
than timers or app blockers. 
 


 I had the same doubts but Brick ended up being way more useful than I expected.
The slower unlock adds just enough friction to break the autopilot feeling. I’ve
definitely cut down on mindless pickups without forcing myself into strict
rules. 
 


 Ironically I've tried this out and it's pretty useful. Even though I am
currently mindlessly on my phone right now. Ignore that!

What I learned while reducing phone screen time by 80% — 6 hrs per day to 1hr,"What I learned while reducing phone screen time by 80% — 6 hrs per day to 1hr

   I have had a very up and down journey with digital minimalism. I've tried to
make improvements and had moderate success. I typically end up spending 4+ hours
on social media (including Reddit) and 2+ hours on messaging and work stuff.
Cutting this down has been life changing.      I feel like my life has slowed
down (in a good way) and I have time for all the things I’ve been wanting to do
(read, meditate, exercise).  My biggest takeaways are:   1. There is more time
in the day than you realize  2. We are meant to be bored sometimes 3. It's
extremely easy to ""slip""  4. Digital minimalism rewires your brain  The biggest
things that helped were:  1. Creating 30 day plan, each week my goal was to cut
back one hour (ended up doing more) 2. Asking “is this the best usage of mental
energy right now?” each time I reach for my phone (I reminded myself to ask this
question with a rubber band over my phone) 3. Having a go to ""redirect"", I keep
a book next to my phone so I can pick that up instead 4. Using an app blocker
with stricter settings than iOS screen time (iOS defaults are too easy to skip)
5. Embrace the boredom, our minds tend to panic when we don't have ""something to
do"", but if you can push through the initial panic, there is a real sense of
calm on the other side  Now I find myself craving more phone free-time, it's
like I've tasted freedom and my mind wants more. I am going to experiment with
longer and longer phone-free breaks. I'm curious to see if I could only check my
phone twice per day.   https://preview.redd.it/mnk6bbi41zpd1.png?width=988&forma

 I like the idea of digital minimalism rewiring your brain. I’ve given up a few
life controlling addictions in the last year, and have found my phone filling
those gaps, creating even less satisfaction with my life.   Which app blocker
did you choose to use? Thanks for sharing what helped you overcome this
addiction 
 
     Honestly I feel like I went down the same path, I gave up a few things that I was addicted to (alcohol,
    cigarettes, adult content), and I ended up filling it with 6 hours of screen time, it almost felt like a
    step backwards in some ways which was frustrating.   Now I feel like I've crossed a threshold where I am
    looking for things I really enjoy to add vs. addicting things (like reading, or even simple walks, or
    stretching...) I think once your mind gets rewired in the right direction your natural cravings can become
    healthier  I tried several app blockers over the last year but the one I stuck with is called roots (I
    like being able to add scroll replacements in the app ex: reading... but I also used opal and jomo in the
    past and they are both solid)

     I use “Screen Zen” and love it.  It drastically cut my phone time down quicker than anything else I’ve
    tried, and it engages my competitive/game completion side.



 Putting a rubber band over your phone is such a good tactic. I’ve never heard of
someone doing that before 
 
     It really makes a big difference!



 Well done!   I may need to take a page out of your book... been a slippery slope
for me lately 
 
     It's a slippery slope indeed... it's crazy because now that I've done it I feel like I should have done it
    a long time ago.   It's something I have been thinking about in the background of my mind for so long but
    just never actually committed to changing.   Good luck!



 I can't find roots on android phone Any good ones on android?? 
 
     I really like StayFocused. I've used it for years!

     Remind Me!3days

     Lock me out is the most effective i feel, after trying many different ones



 What app is this, and is it free? 
 
     Yeah it’s called roots… it’s free. They have a premium upgrade but basically everything you need is in the
    free version in my experience. I ended up doing the premium when I made the 30 day plan so I could go all
    in on and put some skin in the game.



 This is awesome! V helpful and inspiring 
 


 Very interesting!! Thank you for your post!    Do you include your laptop when
you talk about screen time or just phone?  If you own an ereader, do you count
it as screen time or not? 
 


 I tried to download roots just now and its expected download time is 1
December!! Anyone else experience this? 
 
     Great work OP!



 What do you do when you’re pooping? 
 
     Really? As for me, I just poop and go on with random thoughts.   We're already distracted with phone
    through out the day, I don't think it needs to come along while pooping

     Lol, poop… But really it’s a good chance to train my brain not to scroll in all the little moments like
    that



 Idk if this is a silly question but how does one be bored? Lol like what do you
do to let yourself be bored? That reminds me of just staring at your ceiling,
which, no lol 
 
     Honestly great question. It took a while for me to get more ok with it…   For me it’s more about enjoying
    the little things. Like once I’m bored and not scrolling all the time I enjoy basic stuff more like fresh
    air, food, drinking water. Sort of like a mindfulness practice where you are ok with stillness a bit more

Is 6 hours of screen time per day too much even if what I watch is of an academic nature?,"Is 6 hours of screen time per day too much even if what I watch is of an academic nature?

I’m confused bc everyone talks about too much screen time being terrible for
your mental health. I use my phone to watch/read/listen interviews and articles
on art, literature and history, as I have a degree in art history and work on my
writing. I also study Japanese so I have to use online dictionaries a lot, as
well as watch native speakers on youtube. Most of the rest of the videos I watch
are either of historical or academic nature. I use Instagram to post and read
about books and authors.  Is it still too much of screen time in terms of
affecting my life in a negative way?

 it depends, all my time on youtube was also /technically/ educational. but it
was not useful or relevant, and I just used it as a crutch so i couldn’t feel
bored or anxious. I would be listening to something 24/7 and wouldn’t even give
myself time to think. i don’t actually think it was good for me as much as I
told myself it was, due to the “education” it provided. I deleted the youtube
app. Now i only watch/listen when it’s on my TV and for me it feels a lot more
intentional   i’ll also add, it’s fine to watch interesting & educational videos
on youtube but keep in mind the credentials of some creators, not everyone is
truly a historian or an expert on every topic they talk about. i’ve noticed now
that I do my own fact checking that some historical videos are blatantly wrong. 
 


 It’s fine, in my view. The Internet can be an amazing tool for learning and
personal growth but it can also morph into a distraction. As long as you use it
mindfully and know when to shut it off, it’s perfectly fine. 
 


 Do you think it does? Why do you think it might? 
 


 not really, it depends on how you use it. if your screen time is mostly for
studying, researching, and learning, that’s productive use. just make sure to
balance it with breaks, offline reading, exercise, and rest so your eyes and
mind don’t get drained 
 


 I don't think it would be affecting your mental health negatively, but your
physical health certainly. I'm now 27 and just had to buy myself some glasses
after suffering migraine like headaches during exam season. I also feel like I
can stretch all I want but I won't get any more flexible for sitting to much.
It's normal on our society, but I can't help but think it isn't what we're made
for biologically 
 


 That all sounds great.  
 


 If you balance that with physical activity and time spent outdoors (even 1 hr
daily combined), i would argue thats pretty solid and valid 
 


 Are you actually studying? Or are you neglecting real life and wasting time? 
 


 Everything in life is going to look different for each person. Unless you are
noticing a negative impact on your mental health, I wouldn't worry about it.
Usually, for me, 6 hours of youtube feels a lot better than 6 hours of tiktok.
But some would say that 6 hours of anything is a waste of time/bad for your
health. You just have to figure out what works for you 
 


 For me, digital minimalism is about reducing unproductive screen time as much as
possible. If it's for your job or school or even just you using it to educate
yourself, I'd say it's fine. The internet is a useful tool.   If I'm using Zoom
for school or a community event or maps for directions or some other thing for
an assignment, I hardly count it against myself.  Now if I'm scrolling Reddit
when I'm supposed to be doing my homework (\*ahem\*) yeah that counts.

"No Socials, No games but 10h screen time","No Socials, No games but 10h screen time

My phone is my everyday tools and I feel like I'm living in it.  I take notes
with it when I do my research. Some of my  study notes and all my files are
there. I also read with my phone  (this last one is huge because My phone is
basically my e-reader at this point and I love reading)  Is it still addiction
if I genuinely use it like this? I'm very used to it and it's pratical.   I
can't afford a laptop, I'm just a teen and physical books are out of my league.

 I think of of the tenets of digital minimalism is intentionalism. If you are
using your phone intentionally and not getting distracted then it's not bad. A
phone is a tool. It's just a shame it's a tool that's also been designed to get
us addicted to time-wasting. 
 


 I wouldn't say you're addicted. Screen time isn't everything - it's what you do
with the screen time  If you spend 6 hours reading on your phone, it's no
different to reading a paperback for 6 hours.   I would wonder if taking notes
on paper would be a beneficial switch to lower the screen time. Using paper is
supposedly more beneficial for your note-taking and memory, so you could give
that a go 
 


 Why don't you try a physical book (that isn't for school/work) and see what
happens to your screen time? Start with one book, whatever it is you are
thinking about getting next.   Does school not offer a paper route instead? Say,
if your laptop broke or lost its charge or you forgot it? 
 


 If you’re focusing on your screen time and digital minimalism, yes it’s a little
bit much, you may have to consider print your notes out and read it, and try
reading physical books.  If you’re focusing on the usage of your device, imo it
seems alright coz you are using it in a productive way instead of doom scrolling
social apps or shorts. 
 


 Do you feel you're unable to stop, like, when you're not supposed to use the
phone? If yes, that's an addiction, otherwise it's just your job doing things on
the phone. 
 
     The reading part? I could read all day and I don't know if that's a bad or a good thing?



 You're reliant, not addicted.  It's like lighting a fire because you cook on it,
you're not inherently an arsonist. I don't think there's anything bad about your
usage. 
 


 Why are physical books and notebooks out of your league? 
 
     Because I'm broke? Paperback are super expensive in my country. About the notebooks, my handwriting is the
    problem, I'm more likely to be eager to read on my notes app than reading my own writing... And copy paste
    is a good feature when I don't have time to write them myself.



 Why are physical books out of your league? Get a library card and give it a try.
As for bad handwriting start practicing and take analog notes more often. 
 
     As crazy as it might sound, Africa and library card don't exist together, in my country anyway. I wish it
    was that simple. I really wish. We don't have big library here, if I wanted to get a printed edition of a
    book, I'll have to get it delivered overseas and ugh, that's expensive. Thanks for the idea, I'll practice
    my handwriting, hope it will get better.



 I strongly encourage you to try physical books. Why do you think they are ""out
of your league?"" Switching to changing real books again has been a HUGE change
in my life! :)

How much screen time is too much?,"How much screen time is too much?

My average screen time is 3 hours and 20 minutes per day. What’s a goal to go
for?

 I'm at 4 hours now, but I was 12 hours old! 
 


 I envy people here. I’m in a bad state, my daily avg last week was 9h45. If one
day I manage to use “only” 3h/day max, I’d be delighted. 
 
     break the addiction, you got this. It’s an actual addiction that people have and need treatment and real
    effort to overcome.



 My goal is 2.5 hours a day on my phone. But, for me, it's less about the time
and more about what that time is spent doing. If I'm chatting and engaging with
a community I'm a part of on Discord, or reading an ebook, that's not a problem
for me. If I'm scrolling short-form videos or algorithm-driven content on social
media, that's less acceptable. For me. 
 


 I say start small and work your way to less. It's way easier to go from 3 hours
and 20 minutes to 3 hours and 5 minutes. Then 2 hours and 50 minutes. Then 2
hours and 30 minutes.   Each step is win - challenging enough that it requires
effort but small enough that you can consistently build momentum.   Each time
you hit a goal, change it to get better. You'll feel like there's an endless
stream of winning. 
 


 But let’s be honest . The real question is how much time you spend on your
laptop/computer 
 
     Well I mean I guess during work if that’s what you mean? I don’t use my work computer for anything other
    than work and don’t have a laptop



 depends on what you're doing with the time, but i'd say 0-120 minutes for most
people is good. for me it's 240 (4 hours) because i have to study online cause i
am homeschooled. 
 


 Mine is 35 minutes and 21 of it is browsing reddit and the rest is chat. I
usually top around 50-60 minutes but most days around 30 - 40. 
 
     That’s wild. I guess I could see myself getting there but that’s a major shift. Would definitely have to
    cut out youtube



 I'm working on it, but I've been at about 3h45m average the past couple of
weeks.  It depends on if I'm sick, bc then I'm just down & on the phone a ton of
the time.  But I've been pretty good at sticking with the 1 hour of social media
timer & 1 hour of games timer total for the day. The rest of the usage is when
I'm using the phone for work (like communication, searching for things on a
browser, etc.)

Is a small smartphone the answer to reducing screen time and stress?,"Is a small smartphone the answer to reducing screen time and stress?

Hello everyone, I currently have an iPhone and would like to drastically reduce
the amount of time I spend using it. I have deactivated social networks and
everything else, but I spend a lot of time reading newspaper headlines and on
WhatsApp. I need WhatsApp (I live abroad) and Google Maps (I travel a lot).
Unfortunately, it seems that there are no dumbphones with these features. I'm
thinking of buying a very small smartphone (like the Unihertz mini) that
attracts less of my attention and leaving the phone I use for work at home and
using it only as a “tool” for office and bureaucratic tasks. Unfortunately,
everything (banks, government, air tickets, two-factor identification) now
requires a smartphone, and I cannot do without one, as I travel a lot for work
outside my country.    What do you think? Are there any studies that confirm
that smaller sizes reduce usage?   Does anyone have any experience with this?

 IDK about smaller but I put mine in black and white under the accessibility
settings and now noticeably use it a lot less. Something something less dopamine
triggers, I reckon, but it’s just a lot less ‘interesting’ to me now 🙃 
 


 What if you could make your smart phone dumb? Turn on grayscale to reduce the
visual addiction. Turn off notifications for every social media app. There are
Digital Wellbeing apps you could try too.  I was wasting too much time on
scrolling reels last year. So I tried using app blockers, of which [Scroll Break
](https://scrollbreak.vgotchastudio.space/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&u
tm_campaign=launch) worked the best for me.  It requires you to select how long
you plan on using an addictive app in order to unlock it. After the set time is
over, a block screen prevents you from using all the restricted apps for 5
minutes (cooldown period).  It's not a permanent app blocker, just lets you be
in charge of your digital habits by setting time limits in real-time based on
your current situation.  Apart from that, it's important to replace your free
time/ empty time with something creative/ productive otherwise you'll end up
checking your phone again or doomscrolling. 
 


 A smaller screen helps. You can also carry a phone in your travel bag instead of
your pocket. 
 


 I went from a iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone SE 3rd gen initially on my journey and
that helped a lot. I dumbed down the pro max but having a giant phone with a few
apps on it was silly to me. So I moved to a dumbed down se and noticed my usage
went down a lot but it was still functional if I needed. Now I’ve moved to an
Apple Watch for day to day usage and I leave my phone at home or bring it along
if needed for certain things.   So smaller phone can help, but tbh it’s about
the restrictions and not the size. If you are really addicted to checking an app
it’ll be the same on a smaller device if it isn’t locked down.  
 


 I developed my screentime habit on a sony xperia tipo. I now use an iphone 13
mini and the screen size doesn’t influence my behavior at all sadly 
 


 Small smartphones nowadays are 6.3"". Before those were called phablets. Getting
a sub 5"" phone might help depending on how hard for you it will be to use it. If
you have smaller hands I doubt that it will help. But what did it for me was
selling my flagship and buying a TCL Nxtpaper. Much slower, with low end cameras
and e-ink like screen toggle physical button. I always keep it in colored e-ink
mode, and it reverts back automatically when I open camera or gallery which is
convenient. Also uninstalling Reddit and YouTube apps (using only from web
browser) helped. 
 
     Thats cool I did the exact same thing, switched from S23 Ultra to nxtpaper and it helped switching from
    scrolling on insta to reading.   I honestly find the e-ink immitation very solid with the matte screen
    finish.



 I tried the jelly 2 some time ago. Was still using it like a smartphone, but my
eye sight decreased fast. Didn't work for me. Eyesight became better again some
time after 
 


 Hi OP, I use a flip phone with a small screen because I really wanted to make
scrolling harder for me. I've tried all sorts of ways to lessen my screentime on
my smartphone, but it was always too easy to get around those restrictions.
While the smaller screen did help make it harder for me to doomscroll, after a
while my mind adjusted to the size and the addictive nature of scrolling came
back.   I'd say that while smaller screen sizes do add enough friction to make
doomscrolling more difficult, it's not the ultimate fix. What I think really
helps is making your current phone as dumb as possible, keeping it in black and
white mood to reduce the dopamine triggers, and blocking any social media or
unnecessary apps. 
 


  Have a unihertz and I now do not scroll on my cell phone. Only use it for phone
calls and text messages. I use my laptop for all else. It’s great

What organic habits replaced your screen-time/devices?,"What organic habits replaced your screen-time/devices?

It's obviously a given that the majority of us are trying to clean our digital
footprints and devices to live a more fulfilled and purposeful life.  However
i've rarely seen discussion on how and what people are doing to replace less
screen-time or social media? I think this is equally important and will look
different to different people but I think it also gives hope to the
possibilities of the vast world out there that we have somewhat forgotten
exists.

 I don't think this is the answer you're looking for, but I just do *nothing* a
lot more.   Phones have a tendency to fill spaces that are too small to do
anything else in, think about the 5 minutes you have before you have to leave, 5
minutes waiting for the bus/train, those annoying 10 minutes before a meeting.
When it comes to big chunks of time (an hour on the train, an hour at night,
etc.), I've replaced the phone use with reading. But there's no point in picking
up a book for 5 minutes, because by the time you're properly sucked in, time's
already up again. So... nothing. 
 
     Haha nothing is still good. It’s space. That space is usually hijacked by SM crap. We’ve been sold
    ‘nothing’ is value-less but its presence.

     I really enjoy doing nothing during those moments too, gives my brain a few moments to just rest a bit.
    Like waiting at a bus stop, at the Drs or whatever.   I saw an ad for those new Meta VR face things the
    other day and it was advertised as like 'watch a movie when you're waiting for your appointments!' like
    wow we're being encouraged to have ZERO moments alone with our thoughts now.   Otherwise OP, I read,
    journal, puzzle, cook, organise/clean something, practice keyboard, garden - basically try to do something
    with my hands as it keeps my body and brain engaged, the focus is away from the screen because I'm
    concentrating on something tangible.



 To be honest, I still spend a lot of time staring at a screen, but instead of
scrolling through bs and bed-rotting, I use that time to work on my writing
projects. I’ve only been off of social media for about a week this time around,
but have already noticed how much I was neglecting my passions before. 
 
     That still sounds much productive and it’s a passion. Great to hear you’ve find that back again - I think
    writing is so therapeutic for the mind and soul



 In the small spaces of time, I’ll do some breathing exercises. It’s a good way
to trick your brain into calmness. 🤣 Also, I will look at my surroundings with a
“painter’s eye.” What color is that shadow? What colors would I have to mix to
make that shade of green? Would I like this scene in hyper realistic style or
more impressionistic? 
 
     Yes I’ve done some extensive research on breathing exercises and calm of recent. It’s an absolute game
    changer…perfect for anxiety, stress and ADHDers. That’s an interesting take on surroundings, I would like
    to pay more attention generally there



      Cook, exercise, play guitar, poker night, work, travel, journal literally

sit in blissful silence pondering my existence or whatever bullshit i want.  
 


 I have several daily habits that somehow I catch up most on until the end of the
day. Yes some includes my phone but it should.   These habits are morning
walking, meditation, writing a page about anything, duolingo and reading
(paperback). Most days I can complete all, somedays I can miss walking, reading-
when I feel more lazy.  But I can say, the days I complete my daily routine I do
not have time to look at my phone, do not lost my mind in thoughts.  By keeping
on track, this year only I read 55 books, have 270 days mediation & duolingo
streak, lost more than 23 pounds of weight. I am just keeping my body and my
mind with mindful and healthy activities.  I read a lot on philosophy, let me
share a quote which I have internalized with my self-consciousness:  ""You are
what you repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.""-
Aristotle 
 


 I agree, it's not enough to just reduce screen time, it needs to be replaced
with high-quality alternatives.   My two biggest are Mountain Biking and Running
Dungeons and Dragons sessions, both keep me so engaged that I forget my phone
exists. Going to the cinema is a similar situation, but is still staring at a
very large screen I guess.  Keeping my phone out of reach and on charge when
going to bed was also a huge reducer of scrolling for me, it's close enough that
I can still hear my alarm go off, but far enough away that I can't roll over and
grab it. 
 


 I started crocheting to keep my hands busy but I am still kinda watching tv a
lot of the time while doing it. Only one screen tho. 
 


 Guitar and reading. Journaling when I have thoughts I want to share that once
might have been tweets or FB status updates. 
 


 I’ve been doing some light reading, playing Minecraft (I know still a scree but
it’s the one video game and hobby I am. I get to flex my creativity muscles),
journal a lot, take more opportunities for pictures of nature and animals (it’s
making me want to get into photography so bad but I don’t know how to start),
and recently with the holidays, I’ve been decorating my own stockings and it’s
very satisfying. I also keep with the stats on my favorite basketball team
manually which is never something I thought I’d do (digitally or manually)

Thoughts on e-reading screen time?,"Thoughts on e-reading screen time?

I give myself one hour of IG per day to text friends and scroll, but I try to
match that with reading. However, my screen time is the same as if I were to
just scroll during my reading time, which makes me feel a bit.. guilty? Because
I’m technically still using my phone. What are your thoughts? Does it count as
healthy screen time?   EDIT: I should note that I use a matte screen protector
on my phone and reduce the brightness by 90%, so it kinda simulates the feel of
an e-reader!

 I second the idea of reading on a second, e-ink device. It doesn't count towards
your iPhone's screen time which feels nice, plus it's physiologically more
similar to reading a physical book (since the light bounces off the screen
rather than beaming directly into your eyeball.

 No need to overthink it. You've cut back on harmful use, and reading is not
harmful! No need to buy other devices or worry about it at all. Just keep
reading.

being in that wormhole of youtube where you are disinterested in everything and

is showing me how to become invested again. Its truly remarkable. Smartphones
should never have existed. 
 
     do you have any tips on increasing focus. when I start to read (paperbacks as im trying to move away from

    obsessing over page numbers to see when I can go back to screens. I used to be an avid reader and when I
    force myself, I still enjoy books but I just cannot push past this problem.

     How do you utilize a Kindle without looking at the screen?  You have not reduced the viewing time at all
    you just transferred it to a different device.

 Reading and puzzles! Have a puzzle on my dining room table that I sit at if I’m
just chilling at home. Usually if I’m at home I’d just scroll on my phone but
now I just grab a book or sit and do the puzzle. Game changer 
 


 Any minimalism podcast you would recommend? 
 
     The Minimalists podcast is a classic! :D



 omg I love how long your list is!!      I've been reading a ton, getting back
into yoga. I'm hoping to learn how to embroider, that's next up on my list.
here's some ideas for anyone looking!

 During the warm months I was riding my bike a lot, exploring my city, going to
bars and coffee shops with my friends. I picked up a handheld game emulator and
even though it's a screen I love that I am actively using my brain vs doom
scrolling. As it gets colder out I will slowly shift to binging on console games
and books.

Can’t decide - keep my Apple Watch or go completely screen-free?,"Can’t decide - keep my Apple Watch or go completely screen-free?

I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I really want to change something and
declutter my digital life, spend less time looking at screens and just live more
consciously.    I have an iPhone 13 mini and an Apple Watch Series 11. I’ve worn
an Apple Watch for 7 years now. Lately I’ve been thinking about selling it and
getting a WHOOP band instead… or maybe even going completely without any
wearable at all.    On the other hand, the Watch could also replace my iPhone in
some ways, it has cellular, so I could actually leave the house without my
phone. It also has safety features like fall detection, which gives me some
peace of mind.    I could disable *all* notifications and just use it for basic
stuff. But part of me still feels like it keeps me in that “always connected”
mindset.    I also recently became a dad, and sometimes the Watch is genuinely
helpful when you don’t have a free hand. But at the same time, my kid sees me
wearing a screen on my wrist and that just doesn’t feel right.    Has anyone
here been in a similar situation? What would you do in my position? Keep the
Watch but strip it down to essentials? Switch to WHOOP? Or go completely tech-
minimalist?

 I tried whoop and decided I actually don’t care what apps says about my recovery
and readiness let alone pay for it. I stopped wearing my Apple Watch on the
daily, I just use it for workouts. I wear a regular watch all other times. The
mental freedom is amazing. No access to screen or notifications and apps. Just a
time and date on wrist. 
 
     At that point why not just wear a chest strap?



 Is the Apple Watch useful? Would the Whoop be more useful? If you answer, No to
either of these, just buy a Casio normal watch.    If you don’t like your kid
watching you use a screen, then don’t use it, if you want to treat these devices
as tools that’s fine, but if it rubs you the wrong way to use these tools, then
find and get healthier alternatives. 
 


 Since you mentioned being a dad maybe it is still good to be able to be reached
when you're out of the home in case there is an emergency or anything. It seems
like the watch is more of a tool and not something you'd be distracted with for
a long time. 
 


 I also have an iPhone 13 mini.  An Apple Watch can be a first step toward
digital minimalism. You can walk away from the phone, and you are ""still
available for an emergency."" Minimize notifications down to the bare essentials,
and you can begin living your life without a detour into the internet.  A couple
years ago, I ported my primary number to the Apple Watch, and used the Apple
Watch only. There are a few downsides:  1. The battery life is poor if you have
long phone calls 2. The device would overheat and disconnect my phone calls 3.
You realistically need Bluetooth available (car, headphones, etc) most of the
time  My #1 desired feature in a watch, it turns out, is to not have to charge
it. I have a Garmin fitness watch with \~30 days of battery life. I have been
very, very happy with my Garmin.  About the phone, you could consider a dumb
phone (the [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) 3 is the first in a
while that's met my needs), or you can try using the watch and leaving your
phone powered off somewhere. For two years, I kept my iPhone powered off and
hidden in the car. It's there now, and I use it about once a month.  There are
handheld cases for the Apple Watch now (like [this
one](https://beaverlabtech.com/products/repod-c1)), which I would have loved two
years ago when it was my primary phone. It about doubles the size to roughly the
size of a tiny iPod. 
 
     thank you very much! I consider buying the handheld case and try to turn my phone off



 I’ve had the privilege of owning a Whoop 4.0 and an Apple Watch S6 at the same
time, and I wore them both for a year straight. Then for some ungodly reason I
upgraded to a Whoop 5.0 and Apple Ultra 2.  So here are thoughts.  The Whoop is
cool, it’s a 24/7 Health Tracker but that’s all it is… a health tracker with a
$200-350/yr annual membership. If your goal is to reduce screen time, then a
wearable device that basically requires you check the app every morning might
not be the way to go.  Because that’s how the device works, it has no screen
just sensors and algorithms that collect data and informs you how to essentially
live your life. If you were active yesterday and didn’t sleep till late, the app
will tell you to take today slow and focus on recovery. So to get your money’s
worth you have to check the app every morning to get your sleep score, heart
rate, recovery, steps from yesterday etc… Oh and you have to wear the device all
day otherwise you will get notifications from the app that you’re not wearing
the whoop.  While the Apple Watch is a one time payment, no subscription
required and you can configure it to take out your phone less.  You can offline
download Apple Music and Spotify , connects your pods or a Bluetooth speaker and
leave your device at home. I have a Tesla so my watch can unlock my car and I
can drive off without my phone. You can set up notifications so if it some
specific contacts you’ll get the notification on my watch. So for example if the
group chat with the boys hits the phone but not my watch, I know I don’t need to
take my phone out because it’s not that important, but if I get a text from my
mother it’ll buzz the watch and phone, so now I know to pull my phone out. It’s
small stuff like that can reduce screen time, you’ll take your phone to pull up
directions and then you get an email, then a text message and there’s
notifications on Reddit, instead you can just talk into watch and say “take me
to Cane’s” so you don’t get sucked into the trap.  [Here is a video where Matt
D’avella quit his phone for 30days and replaced it with an Apple
Watch](https://youtu.be/H0Cz1T0lQyk) 
 
     thanks!! that helped



 Here are my 2 cents because I am right there with you.   For a while I thought
the Apple Watch was the ultimate answer for digital minimalism. Seems perfect
because I can call/text/music/ maps and it’s just on my wrist and I can leave my
phone home. The problem I found was that I still had to purchase an iPhone in
order for it to work. So I know this is digital minimalism page but if you pay
attention to consumerism this might bother you as it did me. I don’t want to
have to buy 2 things if I only want to use 1. I know I can link it to my wife’s
phone or something but I have never tried that or really liked that idea either.
I also still had the issue with the idea of being constantly connected. I want
time during my day where I am unreachable.   My current set up. I put my Apple
Watch Ultra in the drawer and I have a solar powered Casio. (Thinking of selling
my ultra soon) I have an iPhone 16. Right now I use it as I would a landline. I
leave it home and check it periodically during the day. I don’t get
notifications aside from phone calls and I don’t have social media aside from
the occasional Reddit. I tend to carry a notebook or kindle with me during the
day.   I find the data I got from my Apple Watch nice but also unnecessary for
what I do. I’m not an athlete. I’m just a 30 year old guy trying to be healthy
and stay active. I don’t need all the detailed data for me to do that. (I guess
that’s my hot take). 
 
     Thank you :)



 Do a little experiment. Try to go 1 week (or 2 or a month or whatever) with JUST
the apple watch, using it as a phone replacement as youve described. Then do the
same amount of time with an analog watch (if you have one) + phone. Or no watch
+ phone. Don't buy anything new quite yet, just play around and see what you
like best.

 I switched from Apple Watch to Garmin.   I like tracking my stuff via the watch.
But with Apple I don’t like how connected I was to everyone. Texting and calls
and what not.   Sometimes Garmin will alert you for a call, which is convenient.
But I’m glad I don’t get texts via my watch anymore!   I rarely use the Garmin
app itself.  
 


 I switched from an Apple Watch to an Ōura ring and love it. Gives me more
information than the watch, and actually interprets it, so it’s useful

Best screen time limit apps?,"Best screen time limit apps?

Heyy  So… I struggle with tech addiction.  I have for years and it’s very much
still a work in progress.  I have an Apple phone.  I used to have my screen time
limit set where someone could put pick a passcode (my sister, dad and best
friend had it) so that I couldn’t unlock it. This didn’t fix everything but it
did help.   Well… my phone broke about a year ago… I had to get a new one.
Apple has changed the way screen time limit works. It’s been pretty unhelpful
for me, now.  Even if someone has the passcode… you can still turn off screen
time at any time.   I got Norton family, which helps with one aspect of my tech
addiction- porn.  It doesn’t really limit screen time… at least for Apple
phones.  Highlyyyy recommend that to anyone struggling with porn, though, and
for that alone… it works realllyyy well. Too well, almost hah (blocking some
things that are super irrelevant to porn but I guess trigger the system…).  My
sister runs that for me.   Anywaysssss  Any suggestions for a screen time
limiting app that someone else can run/can’t be deleted off my phone?  Ive heard
of bark, opal, Qustodio, etc…  Hoping to have one that:  -Limits screen time
-blocks porn and specific sites (I have Norton family, but ideally I would have
an app that is good for both screen time and blocking porn/specific sites
because then I wouldn’t have to pay for Norton family, too).  -blocks apps at
times I set   Thank you 🙏   P.s- I also have a flip phone! Maybe at some point I
will switch entirely flip phone. My flip phone helps me to take a break. I have
a lock box, to put my iPhone in when I use my flip phone. Right now I still use
my iPhone for zoom meetings, etc… and I don’t have great WiFi on my computer
right now (where I live) so currently I rely on cellular, half the time.  I may
go to the library to do zooms in the future, etc…  But for right now… a good app
would be helpful for me.   Also… a screen time limiting app that could work on
my apple computer, too!  (Ideally… the same app as for my phone… so I don’t have
to pay twice. But if that’s not possible, I’d love any suggestions for my
computer, as well)

 HI! I recommend Opal. I'm trying to reduce the time I spend on the screen too
(especially traditional social media) and I have to admit that Opal is giving me
an edge! Good luck 
 
     This is interesting, hadnt heard of it, what has it helped with?



 Bro, I entered your requests into AI because I don't understand this myself,
sorry. He advises Qustodio

Asked my boyfriend to put a screen time limit on my phone with a passcode,"Asked my boyfriend to put a screen time limit on my phone with a passcode

I have tried to put limits for screen time on my phone sooo many times but I
just don’t have the self control to not press the ignore button. I finally had
enough and asked my bf to put a limit of 3 hours a day and come up with a
passcode so I can’t bypass it. I know a 3 hour limit is honestly pathetic but it
would be a huge improvement from my 6-8 hour daily average. I trust him and know
if we ever broke up that he would give me the code, but even if he wouldnt for
some reason I am able to change it with my apple ID (obviously I’m not going to
go through the effort of doing that every time I run out of screen time). He
also added some apps that will always be allowed that he deemed as “productive
apps” like the calculator, the finch app, duolingo, etc. Today is the first day
ever with a limit I cannot ignore. It has already been a hard adjustment tbh,
but I’m excited to focus more on my hobbies and fulfilling activities. I have
noticed that I have already been more mindful about spending time on social
media because I didn’t want to waste all of my screen time on instagram at the
beginning of the day.

 ive always wondered about doing this- ill be curious to hear an update in a few
months. might be good to have some ground rules a head of time on if/when you're
alowed to renegotiate screentime, etc 
 
     I’ll definitely be doing an update. I won’t be able to have him put in the code to give me more screen
    time unless we are together because we don’t live together and he would need to put the code in on my
    phone.

     Renegotiate screen time?



 Love this approach honestly - having someone else set the passcode is brilliant
because you're acknowledging the real problem (willpower fails when the dopamine
craving kicks in).    3 hours is actually a solid target, don't call it
pathetic! Going from 6-8 hours to 3 is cutting your usage in half. That's huge.
The mindfulness part you mentioned is key - when you know you only have limited
time, you naturally become more intentional about how you use it. We've seen
this pattern a lot with people trying to break social media habits. Also would
recommend to use Elqi app to build a balance. This sounds really cool! I'm
definitely interested in seeing where you take this.    The dopamine redirection
angle is spot on - most people think its just about willpower but it's really
about understanding the neurochemistry behind why we reach for our phones. When
I was building Elqi, one of the biggest insights was that blocking apps doesn't
work long term because it doesn't address the underlying dopamine seeking
behavior. Elqi tracks and manages your dopamine and then forces you through
dopamine detox exercises before opening addictive apps. Like that a dopamine
detox becomes part of every day life. Would really recommend trying it out!
Also props to your bf for adding productive apps to the ""always allowed"" list.
Smart move because you dont want to feel completely cut off from useful stuff.
The fact that you're already noticing changes on day one is a really good sign
btw. 
 
     Thanks for your comment, I really appreciate it :) I think its just a habit for me to put myself down but
    yeah, 3 hours is a huge improvement and I should be proud of that!!  Thanks for the suggestion too. I will
    definitely check out elqi.



 Very good. Three hours isn't pathetic. Progress is progress. Good luck!

iOS screen time inaccuracies,"iOS screen time inaccuracies

Sorry to be back with another question so soon, wasn’t expecting to run into
this one! 🥲   I’ve been using Screen Time limits to slowly crank down how much
I’m on each app, but apparently screen time on Apple/iOS is buggy as all hell
right now. For example, it says I’ve been on my phone for 14 hours today, and I
haven’t even been awake 14 hours, let alone on my phone for that long. The
values/individual breakdown also is incorrect, it’s closer to around 6 hours but
says 2 of those hours were spent on iMessage when I know that’s false.   I’m
worried about my app limits not working because of these misreadings/bugs. If
it’s not accurately counting my screen time, I can’t really trust the limit to
go off, right?    I have the Refocus app but that just utilizes Screen Time, so
it has the same wrong information. I can still straight up block apps, but I was
hoping to be able to do 1 hour, 2 hour total limits etc. Should I be looking for
another limiting app that counts time separately, or are they all connected to
the official Screen Time like Refocus is?

 (this might be the first time I see an organic post about Refocus on Reddit,
cool!)  When you view the ""Report"" tab, assuming your app is updated, there is a
""question mark"" on the [top right corner with a lot of
information](https://refocusapp.notion.site/Refocus-
Reports-1832fd62e7af80009216d1b6df25d80b?pvs=4) - inlcluding tips on how to
avoid some of this. Another option to mitigate is to use the ""Exclude Screen
Time"" feature in Refocus. All that being said, if you utilize all the tips on
the website, it should be relatively OK.  > I’m worried about my app limits not
working because of these misreadings/bugs. If it’s not accurately counting my
screen time, I can’t really trust the limit to go off, right?  It's a valid
worry. That being said, I rarely find issues with limits in practical day to day
use. Some tips to follow: 1) Make sure ""Share Across Devices"" is turned off in
Apple Screen Time settings 2) Don't set limits on a LOT of apps together, set
limits on individual/specific apps, or just a few (do not select ""categories"")
3) Don't use restrictive Strict Modes until you are confident it's working for
your use-case day-to-day  > Should I be looking for another limiting app that
counts time separately, or are they all connected to the official Screen Time
like Refocus is?  I hope you always use the app that is best for you, so none of
this is to deter you from switching: I believe utilizing Apple Screen Time is
the only ""good"" option any app has. The other option is maybe VPN? But that
can't be reliable.   -  Despite all the bugs with Apple Screen Time, it's still
the best option we have on the iPhone so we just gotta make use of what it
provides. I've been utilizing it for over 2 years and its practically  fine. If
one learns its problems, and performs the right mitigations, it will mostly do
what you expect (except maybe the screen time calculation will be somewhat off
some days 😅). 
 
     Oh wow, if I’d have known you were going to respond I would’ve written a more eloquent post! 😅   Thank you
    so much for the response! I only got Refocus recently but I am a fan of it, all of my beef is with Apple
    which isn’t shocking as they’ve been going downhill for years. I searched under the iOS sub and a lot of
    people have been having issues with screen time including since the most recent update. I guess I’m lucky
    because some somehow have screen times over 24h just for the day LOL. I don’t blame you guys at all for
    being based of it through, it makes total sense and it seems as through you kinda need that setting to
    work properly.   I will check out the tips you wrote! It should be impossible for it to be a cross-
    device/shared-device issue as I don’t have any other Apple devices or any third parties connected to my
    phone, but I’ll check that out anyways as well just in case. Thanks again! And I’m honored to be the first
    post, I do believe I found it from a mention this sub :)



 [removed] 
 
     Refocus allows you to block for set periods and that’s what I’ve been using, unless I’m misinterpreting
    what you mean! But the issue is (I think at least), when I’m blocking apps say from 12am to 9am and then
    12pm to 4pm, it’s counting the active blocking as screen time. Hence why it’s saying I’m on like 18 hours
    a day when my phone isn’t even turned on 18 hours a day. I will check out FocusPledge, I am on iPhone,
    thanks!

Removed Time on Apple Watch,"Removed Time on Apple Watch

My GF wanted a day without her phone or to even look at the time. So I though
how can you have the most minimal setup and only have the Apple Watch for
emergencies. There's no way to remove the time. So the next best thing is a full
gray screen and the time in a font that you can't read, it's all blended in.  ht

6e3dba9e2261f52333892187bb366fcf9d  Simply grab the same color as the Time Color
slider and use that as the Photo. #66656A for the Gray works very well  Then do
the usual stuff to remove distractions. Silence all notifications and calls etc
I found ""MALAYALAM"" to be the smallest and most obscure Numerals option for
myself.

 What’s wrong with having the time on? That’s a little extreme… 
 


 Why would you make it so the time is barely readable on a watch? 
 


 This is not minimalism. Removing the time on an Apple watch is like buying a
Ferrari and having the engine removed. It doesn't make sense. Absolutely
laughable. 
 


 Why not simply get rid of the watch in this case? Put it away in a pocket, it
will serve the same emergency purpose with even less distraction. 
 
     That’s a good point.



 Just turn always on display and raise to wake off? 
 
     Would that do it? So the only way to wake the watch wound be to tap it?



 u/protonfission I appreciate you sharing this idea. I think people are missing
the fact that you said your girlfriend only wants to do this for ONE DAY.   But
even if she wanted to do it all the time, I don’t know why people are up in arms
about it. You’re just sharing your solution. Even if no one else ends up using
it, it’s nice of you to share. 
 


 Not having the time is a good idea imo. Time itself was invented for work. Even
on our days off, we check the time to know when we need to have chores done by
and go to bed for work, etc. This is a nice way for her to free herself from the
concept for a little while 
 


 Smart.  Eta: downvotes? Not smart, I guess.

 Sorry to say that but not a single tool is gonna help. Tried all of them,
including the ones mentioned.  They are like a gym membership. They work at the
beginning before the effect goes away. The reason is that they treat screen time
and that’s the symptom, not the root cause.  You need to figure out and treat
what makes you pick up the phone, then your screen time goes down automatically
as a consequence.  Can’t type more now haha, but happy to chat. DM me if you

 If you have an iPhone…beginning with iOS 16 there’s a bunch of third-party apps
that try to simplify blocking apps & websites on the iPhone. The feature you are
talking about is usually called “app limits” or “time limits.” I recommend
searching “website blocker”, or “app blocker time” on the App Store and trying a
bunch. The great thing is that many are quite differentiated, and offer free
tiers, so you can try until you find one that works for you. The one that I’m
building for my needs is [Refocus](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-
store/id1645639057?pt=646847&ct=reddit&mt=8).

Screen time apps,"Screen time apps

I have tried a bunch of screen time apps and they are all quite glitchy, like
they will say I’ve run out of time when I haven’t, or they won’t actually be
able to block an app that I asked them to. I think it must be a bit tricky to
sync with apple’s screen time features. Does anyone have one that works really
well?

 I’ve tried a bunch of screen time apps too and this glitchiness seems to be
pretty common. From what I’ve heard it’s an issue with apple screen time. On
some devices it’s much worse.   In general I have seen less issues since I
updated to ios18 and stopped using low power mode (I think the latter was
causing a lot of the issues).   I also found that there are also some settings
that help with the accuracy on these types of apps like turning off share across
devices setting.   Honestly it’s super annoying that these issues are on most of
the apps out there. 
 
     And to your original question, I’m using Roots now and it has been pretty reliable, especially when I’m
    not in low power mode.   Jomo was also pretty reliable when I didn’t have low power mode on during
    testing.   I really hope apple works to stabilize this soon…



 A lot of these apps depend on Apple Screen Time technology which is a bit buggy.
Particularly when it comes to unblocking apps (sometimes!).  Some of these bugs
are only fixable by Apple. However, it IS hard to get the apps right so it takes
some skill beside the unfixable bugs.  Two quick tips: 1) only have ONE of the
screen time apps installed, multiple WILL cause issues  2) download iOS 18 as
it’s the best this technology has been   Now I’m biased but I care a lot to get
it right and IMO [Refocus](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-
store/id1645639057?pt=646847&ct=reddit&mt=8) is pretty much as good as it will
get in terms of reliability. All of these apps are a little different so I can’t
claim Refocus will suit you better than others, but I do believe in the
reliability advantage. That being said, as I mentioned, there are bugs that
Refocus can’t fix. The app tries to highlight them and there is a whole page
describing 20+ of things that might be unexpected.

     In my experience Apple’s screen time just kind of chooses a semi-random app and then says you spent all
    day in that app. I’ve had days where I left my phone in the other room and it said I had 9 hours of screen
    time on Calendar, weather, or some equally random app like Contacts. Today in spite of the fact that I
    haven’t used Safari at all, (my phone hasn’t really been on my person today because I’ve been super busy
    with work) it says that I’ve used Safari for 3.5 hours. And no, I don’t have it syncing between my
    devices. This is just for my iPhone.  I don’t even bother with it because it’s so inaccurate. There is
    absolutely no way I’m spending an average of 9 hours and 45 minutes on my phone every single day.

     When you add up the itemized time you spend on individual apps, it often doesn't add up to the same number
    that is shown as the total screen time number.  The total screen time number is usually much higher and
    accounts for 'other' time as shown in the gray bar in the chart.   Nobody knows what this is and Apple
    hasn't released any info about it despite being asked numerous times.

Working on decreasing screen time,"Working on decreasing screen time

I have been working on decreasing my screen time and have been trying to by
looking at minimal app launchers, I tried Blank Spaces but didn't want to pay
and thought it was pretty boring after a bit too. I liked the aesthetic and was
looking for something similar. I found limpio which is a pretty good, it has the
title on the widget which is a bit annoying but i got used to it pretty quickly.
But it has helped my reduce my screen time so much, I went from 5 hours a day to
2/3 and just makes my phone feel so much cleaner. I also deleted instagram and
most other social media applications. Slowly getting there but happy to have
apps that help.  https://preview.redd.it/676wevou4ozc1.png?width=1179&format=png

 When blank spaces trial was over, I ended up moving to just going everything on
spotlights search so i actually have to think of an app i want to use before
searching for it 
 
     Honestly I haven't thought of this before. I think once I get in a good spot with this look and feel
    comfortable cutting back more Ill give this a try!

Frustrated with Apple screen time,"Frustrated with Apple screen time

I need some advice about how to restrict screen time on my iPhone, or whether I
should switch to android as a whole.  Screen time on Apple is bogus as you can
easily bypass the password that a friend made by clicking  forgot my password if
you’re logged in to your Apple ID.

 You could have the friend do full-on parental controls.  But yeah, I’m having
trouble respecting the limits I’ve put in place, and I don’t anticipate I’d be
any better on Android. I think I’m going to have to go full dumbphone to solve
this.

passcode on the site and to retrieve it, you have to go through a tedious 20 min

I did a 30-day digital detox and realised I've been addicted to my phone since my teens,"I did a 30-day digital detox and realised I've been addicted to my phone since my teens

Inspired by Cal Newport's digital minimalism, I did a month long digital detox.
My scree**n**time habits were awful. I would wake up and scroll immediately. If
I was in a queue at a shop I would scroll. I could be talking to my partner and
start scrolling. Something needed to change. Here's some of the things I
noticed.  **A lot of it is unconscious.** The reflexive phone grabbing was
genuinely disturbing. I would be working away on my laptop and next thing I know
my phone is in front of me with a twitter feed open. No conscious thought
involved. Or I'd want to tell my girlfriend something and reach for my phone to
text her... when she's sitting in the next room. We live together. I could just
walk over and talk to her like a normal human. Or I'd find myself endlessly
opening slack looking for a dopamine hit.  **Mornings were unreal.** When you're
not doomscrolling in bed, it turns out you can get an insane amount done before
work. 7:30 wake up, and by 8am I'd showered, shaved, made coffee, done dishes,
sorted my budget for the week. When you're constantly held down by your phone
it's like wading through mud. Every simple task takes 10x longer.   **It made
sports feel very different.** My team had a slew of huge games that month.
Normally I'd be online soaking up all the build-up, player stats, conspiracy
theories about the ref's family history, etc. Or if there was a controversial
ref decision and I couldn't check reddit or twitter to see if people agreed with
me. That urge to validate my reactions through the internet was stronger than I
expected. It was genuinely tough. But I found myself talking to colleagues,
friends and family about games a lot more to compensate. And if we lost I just
got over the game normally, instead of stewing on social media.   **Work
performance went through the roof**. My job is target-based and I absolutely
smashed my numbers. Turns out when you're not constantly switching from Twitter
to TikTok to Youtube you can actually do your job well. But on the flip side I
also realised how mind-numbingly boring my job is without podcasts and social
media to get me through it.   **Sleep became incredible.** Asleep by 11, up at
7:30 most days. My brain was running at such a slower pace settling down for bed
at 10 just felt natural. I'd read a few pages and fall asleep within about 15
mins.   **Started reading more.**  I read about 3 books in a month. I normally
read but when I had proper downtime or wanted to enjoy a weekend morning, I'd
read with a cup of coffee or tea.   **Appreciated Music again.** I'd mostly
stopped listening to music during the detox, and the last day of the month I
went to a live concert. Once I stopped constantly listening to music all day
everyday, I came to appreciate it again. Beforehand I would be constantly
shuffling between my spotify playlists never satisfied.  **Tried random
hobbies** one weekend I noticed by kitchen knife was really blunt. I walked to a
cooking shop and bought. whetstone. I watched two YouTube tutorials on how to
use it, then spent hours sharpening my knife. Reminded me how fun learning
random little skills can be and how the internet should aid that not take you
away from it.   **Present with people.** Conversations with my girlfriend felt
more present. Because I wasn't being so stimulated all the time, I remembered
that conversations with human beings are supposed to be stimulating in
themselves. The weekends weirdly felt longer. Like time was more of a blank
canvas for me to add things to rather than something that just passed by on
autopilot.   **Started feeling out of the loop with humour.** So much humor with
friends and colleagues is based around current reels and TikToks. They'd be
making jokes all day that would go straight over my head. A week prior to my
detox I'd be getting it. One week later I'm lost. Crazy how quickly it moves.
**It's not a cure all.**  it takes things away but doesn't automatically fill
the void. I had to actively push myself the following month to sign up for
sports classes and actually prioritize leisure time with active pursuits like I
wanted to do during my detox. The detox creates space and allows you to take
stock of your situation and reprioritise, but you still have to choose what to
put in it.  **I feel like a calmer, more normal human.** And you really notice
other people's phone habits now. The constant checking, the mid-conversation
scrolling. It's everywhere once you step outside it.  **It gets boring then it
gets fun.** To give an example, before I could never commit to a Netflix series.
Or when selecting a film to watch with my partner I had to make sure it was
super highly rated or my attention span wouldn't let met sit still. A few days
into the detox I could sit through an entire 1 hour episode with my partner and
want to watch the next episode (one of my rules was I was allowed to watch
Netflix provided it was with my partner after work and not mindlessly on my
own). It was the same with films, even films that aren't great are still
stimulating. By making day to day life less stimulating you open yourself up the
things you previously thought were boring. It's like quitting sugar then
realising how sweet cherrys and apples can be.   **A Month Later.** I still
haven't touched Twitter, TikTok, or Instagram reels specifically. There is some
trepidation there that if I go back I will slip back. I realised that they
aren't that fun compared to real life and it's not how I want to spend my time.
But at the same time I know they could suck me back in. I still think there
could be value in maybe having one day a week where you use those platforms like
Cal Newport suggests. Candidly I have discovered great music, places to visit,
places to eat, and picked up new interests through those platforms so I know
there's value there, but I still need to work out how I'll go about it.   **Big
picture takeaway and regrets.** After the detox I did feel a tinge of sadness. I
enjoyed it so much. But I realised properly that I had been addicted to the
internet and my phone since I was a teenager. Not just in a ""oh I use my phone a
lot"" way but in a compulsive and unconscious way. I thought back to my life. The
skills I could have learnt, places I could have gone to, experiences I could
have had. I did an extremely interesting degree and a great university, but I
never really engaged with the material. The whole time I've had access to much
easier and exciting hits of dopamine.   Overall, I felt quite dumb. I'd always
saw myself as quite a switched on guy but the realisation that I spent such a
huge amount of my limited time on earth staring at a screen because tech
companies got me with a simple chemical trick was disheartening. I thought of
smoking addicts in the 1950s or fast food addicts in recent times, and realised
I was no different. The environment was designed in such a way that my basic
operating system was overloaded and didn't have a chance. I'm in my late 20s and
I think lots of people my age probably feel similar. We came of age at a time
where tech hit such a zenith but there was no precedence in place to know how to
deal with it and we were caught hook line and sinker. I think that was the main
value of the detox, to take a step back and divorce yourself from the system as
much as possible and see it for what it is.  **TL;DR: Did a month-long digital
detox inspired by Cal Newport. Discovered my phone habits were genuinely
addictive and unconscious - I'd reflexively grab my phone mid-conversation or
text my girlfriend when she was in the next room. Results: Morning productivity
skyrocketed, work performance through the roof, sleep became incredible, started
reading 3 books/month, conversations felt more present. Downsides: Felt out of
the loop with friends' meme references, realised how boring my job actually is
without distractions. A month later, still too anxious to touch
Twitter/TikTok/Instagram reels. Biggest realization: I've been genuinely
addicted since my teens and feel sad about all the lost potential and skills I
could've learned, experiences I missed while staring at screens. The detox
creates space but you have to actively choose what to fill it with. Overall feel
like a calmer, more normal human who can actually appreciate simple pleasures
again.**

 That was a great read, thanks for sharing. Congrats on the detox and reclaiming
your life! I feel inspired now to do the same. I really like Cal Newports
teachings as well, and need to read and employ his suggestions again.       I
was doing really well when we lived more mindfully, but the last few years have
been back to the grind of modern life and discovered again that this lifestyle
doesn’t work for us. Then the tech use starts ramping up, I suppose as a
distraction, that quickly spirals back into addiction. Absolutely hate predatory
tech! 
 


 Can I ask how you structured and maintained this detox? Did you get a dumb
phone? Did you lock your phone away? Did you still use social medias on your
computer? Cheers! A great read.  
 
     Second this. As I read from my phone

     I would love to hear more on this as well. It feels unrealistic to go without your phone entirely in the
    21st century but I'm really looking for ways to re-train myself to stay off of it until its actually
    needed.



 The humor thing is so real. I never really got into TikTok, and at a certain
point I couldn't even easily load them in-browser if someone sent me one
directly, I had to have the app. I honestly lost a friend group this way...I
just had nothing to talk about with them or no frames of reference. I'd get
things a week later on Instagram reels, and once I cut Instagram I never got
them at all.  I feel like I lack a lot of the ""funny"" I used to share with
others, like it's really difficult for me to connect through humor which was my
go to before.  I think I prefer myself this way, not placated by funny all the
time? But I also feel isolated and like I've lost a channel of passive
interaction that did make friendships easier. 
 
     This is absolutely wild to me as an elder millennial. Really struck me reading OP mention it too. How did
    a whole generation get to the point of internet content dominating *this* much of their lives, down to the
    way they socialize in person?  There’s got to be a significant portion like you who don’t see the value in
    that, or rather are noticing how bizarre and unfulfilling that is. I feel bad that that’s what you’re up
    against and I hope you’re able to make new friend groups with like minded people.

     If you delete text following the ""?"" in the URL you can play it in browser



 Thanks for sharing this and congratulations! I'm so pleased you had such a
positive experience and wish you all the best.  I would suggest that you try and
stop thinking of yourself as ""dumb"" though! In this fight, it's just our monkey
brains against trillion-dollar corporations with very smart people whose job it
is to exploit us.   If you haven't already, I'd really recommend you read
""Stolen Focus"" by Johann Hari. It's a brilliant read and really capture these
ideas so well. 
 
     I second this. I've heard of space engineers leaving their job to work for companies that specialize in
    retaining app usage, they design these to keep you addicted which is so unfair to the larger population.



 I tried to detox from social media. I uninstalled insta for a while and felt
like I have all the time in the world. However my FOMO kicked in way up and I
always felt like I have zero clue what my friends are doing and felt out of
place in a group conversation. After a week or so I just got back on the app.
How did you manage the FOMO? 
 


 This is such an inspiring read - thank you for sharing your experience so
honestly. The part about unconscious phone grabbing really resonates, and it's
amazing how you were able to recognize those patterns and make such meaningful
changes.  For anyone looking to build awareness around their digital habits
(whether starting a detox or maintaining changes afterward), I've found tracking
tools can be really helpful for that initial reality check. We actually created
a digital wellbeing tracker at [https://positive4mind.com/wellbeing-
tracker/](https://positive4mind.com/wellbeing-tracker/) that helps people
monitor their screen time patterns and set intentional boundaries.  What you
said about the detox creating space that you then have to actively choose how to
fill is so spot on. It sounds like you've done the hard work of not just
removing the distractions but also building those new habits and hobbies that
actually fulfill you.  Really appreciate you taking the time to write this all
out - I imagine it'll help a lot of people who are recognizing similar patterns
in their own lives. 
 


 I love that you point out the big regret. I've never reflect on that to put in
word but I felt that a lot after digital detox. SO MUCH time and potential lost.
I could have done so many things more. We need to move on and look ahead :) 
 


 loved the read, really excited about where the detox is taking you! i had a
similar situation, and though i still have any things i need a detox from (like
my crippling youtube addiction) i'm in a much better place now. keep going down
this path, you won't regret it. 
 


 Thank you for sharing! Great read

My husband and I are both addicted to screens and I'm scared it will never stop.,"My husband and I are both addicted to screens and I'm scared it will never stop.

My husband and I (26 and 25, respectively) have been hooked on screens for our
entire lives. We both got smart devices at a young age and consequently
developed addictive behaviors, including p\*rn starting at around age 10 for
each of us. This was before the advent of short-form media, but we both spent
our formative years on YouTube, social media, Reddit, and other sites. Since
short-form media took over, it's only gotten worse. We've tried using Apple's
Screen Time feature with me setting a passcode on his phone and vice versa, but
it's not a foolproof system and it doesn't account for laptops. We've tried
setting goals for ourselves, but we inevitably just don't adhere to them when
we're tired, stressed, or sad. We've tried making plans for non-digital dates
and activities, like buying puzzles and games, but they end up forgotten in
favor of a movie or scrolling YouTube together. We both turn to YouTube first
thing in the morning and last thing at night, and my husband can't even fall
asleep without YT videos playing. I spend my day at work trying (and failing) to
stay off my phone and my productivity suffers immensely. It seems like every
spare moment for each of us is spent on the internet, including when we're
spending time together - I go to the bathroom and when I come back out, he's
scrolling. And vice versa.   We both come from families where screen addiction
is prevalent, and it's something we both desperately want to change instead of
passing that behavior down to our future children. But I feel like we're neck-
deep in it and I don't know how we can get out. Both of us experience this -
when we try to have an internet-free day, we feel anxious or depressed. We don't
have the attention span or motivation to try new things, despite deeply desiring
hobbies. And for me, it's a vicious cycle with my ADHD, with the internet
addiction and ADHD making the other worse. For my husband, it's the same thing
with depression.  We just got married and moved in together, and it's made me
realize just how much we're both completely addicted. It's been hugely bothering
me, but I don't know what to do about it. I just feel hopeless. How can we ever
stop? How can we change what's so deeply ingrained, especially when technology
is so interwoven into everyday life?

 You're never going to be able to 'flip a switch' that changes this. You need to
introduce other things as entertainment (reading, writing, movies, radio, etc.)
while also REMOVING ALL SCROLLING APPS from your phone - only access these
platforms through a desktop computer from now on. Don't be hard on yourself when
you don't change immediately, just allow the better options to exist in your
world. Your routine will gently change over time as you reduce the tension, and
become more familiar with new routines. You'll be so glad you did! You got this. 
 
     The desktop computer tip is underrated

     What about when the desktop computer is just as much of a problem as the phone?

     It's alot less satisfying to scroll on the desktop for sure

     Fully agree on the introducing other sources of entertainment, that's a big part of the book Digital
    Minimalism as well. I am not a big fan of accessing those platforms on the computer, as I prefer to use my
    laptop a work-only device.  What I currently do, is to use an app called TimeCap to remove reels&shorts
    from social media; so that I can still keep in touch with friends without frying my brain with content.
    The downside is that you have to scroll through TimeCap, and not the official apps, but it is well-worth
    it for all the time and mental health you get back.  But everyone should experiment and figure out
    strategies that work for them, as there is really not a one-size-fits-all solution

     yep, it's about what you replace it with



 If it’s very bad, you both need to get dumb phones or start locking your phones
away when at home. Get more busier as well with work, hobbies, and extra
curriculars. 
 


 What I’m seeing a lot of people struggling with on this sub is they “try” to
limit their screen time but then keep falling into the same habits.   You need
to find hobbies. One that doesn’t involve a screen.   This is a lot easier said
than done (I’ve been working on lower my screen time for a few months now) but
start slow. I now sew, rock climb, read, train my dog in dog agility, and will
be taking a pottery class next month.   Trying to stop using your phone is
awesome but you’re going to keep reaching for it if you don’t try to fill your
time with other things. 
 
     I think it’s different for everyone. You have to find your own root cause and how to fix it.   For me
    hobbies aren’t the issue, I’ve always had plenty of hobbies. Its when I’m tired and don’t have enough
    energy to do any of my hobbies that I get sucked into my phone. 



 I would recommend 2 things.   A physical hobby that gets you moving, like
walking or an exercise class outside the house. That way you have a time where
you basically can’t be on your phone and your body is being rewarded with
endorphins in the process.   Second is get a paper journal. Set a timer (one not
on your phone if possible) and give yourself 10 mins to journal daily. You can
write about how you wish you were scrolling haha or about your actual life or
how it feels to not scroll etc. I’d say don’t start with more than 10 mins at
first unless the timer stops and you want to keep going. The small commitment
will make it doable. You can also spend the time making lists of things you
might like to do that aren’t on your phone. I also have ADHD and I love a good
list haha!   As others have said deleting your apps or getting a dumb phone will
help too, but these are baby steps that can help you move in the right
direction.   Also don’t beat yourself up if you fall back into old habits, just
try to be aware and move forward when you see it.   You got this!! 💖

     I second Atomic Habits. It changed the game for me



 Thx for sharing this and good for you guys!  I mean the first step to fixing a
problem is knowing it’s there.    To feel better about this you could start
talking up schools and teens about your issue- who knows it may blow up into a
huge movement.  You are welcome to message me if you ever want encouragement on
this.  I have a teen we haven’t given a smart phone yet- and I feel awful for
this- never thought functioning in the title would involve introducing something
so highly harmful as screens.  My teen detests what her peers do with their time
and is like omg they aren’t happy- depressed etc….   We’ll all I can say is
connect with gen x people- we’re flexible and know how it was before screens how
to function etc…  join local non profit and volunteer in person.  Goto the opera
and ballpark.  Just start living.  Get books and put your phone in a drawer. Or
break your phone literally.   You’re a breath of fresh air for your generation
keep it up it’s only the beginning of great things to come. 
 


 Text each other to download an app or timers to stop the addiction. Use a spark
in the fire 🔥 to fight the fire 
 


 I'm so screen addicted that I asked my husband to manage my Screentime with a
passcode that I don't know. You could both do that for each other. 
 
     We do that already, and it's worked alright for the phones. The issue is that laptops and TV are just as
    much of a problem.



 The book Stolen Focus by Johann Hari helped me a lot when I first started my
offline journey. It will show you that you are not alone in this struggle as the
author documents his various methods for going offline. I had this problem back
in 2022 when i started posting heavily on tiktok and the views and content
creation of it all became addicting and took me away from my job. I am in a much
better place right now and have a better hold of my addiction (because it really
is one). Good luck to you!!  
 
     Really good book. Despite some past controversy of the author 😉



 I bought a lock with a timer. I put my laptops, phone, tv remotes, and desktop
mouse in a suitcase and lock it for a few hours. It's helped a lot. I usually
fall asleep for half an hour but then wake up and start cleaning, doing chores
and reading, purely out of boredom.

I need help to reduce my screen time on my iPad. Can I use a password?,"I need help to reduce my screen time on my iPad. Can I use a password?

I’ve been using the Screen Time feature included in iOS, but it’s way too easy
to bypass. So I was wondering if I could use a password.  I know you can set up
a PIN, but that only works to prevent changing the Screen Time settings. If I
add time restrictions for certain apps, I can still bypass them easily by adding
an exception for the next 15 minutes every time, or worse, for the entire day,
which IMO defeats the whole purpose of this feature.  I have near-to-zero
willpower so I really need this. Obviously the idea here would be to create a
password and put it in hands of a trusted third party (friend, family member,
etc.)  Does anyone know if this is possible and how?

 No it’s not possible unfortunately. That’s where Apple pulled a trick on us
sadly. Best blocking software for any mobile Apple advice is still just the
power button. Commit to times of the day where you don’t use your iPad at all.
Have highly engaging alternative tasks to keep you occupied in the meantime.
Right now I turn off my devices at 9 PM  everyday. I also turn them off at
meals, commutes, and social gatherings. All these little commitments to screen
free time will lower your screen time in the long run.  Here’s a list of offline
activities you can try: https://old.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/wiki/offline?
utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf 
 
     That’s a real bummer. What’s the purpose of Screen Time then? (Btw, is it solved on iOS 13?)  Regarding
    your suggestion, yeah, but nothing prevents me from grabbing and turning on my iPad again if I’m feeling
    too anxious.



 There is a way! A redditor created an app that creates a password for you, and
then blocks you from accessing it. It also includes a memory game to make you
forget the code.   You can find the app [here](https://passcode-
generator.herokuapp.com/). 
 


 You can use the PIN? 
 
"
Apple screen time wonkiness,"Apple screen time wonkiness

I know this isn’t directly DM related, but figured you all might be able to
help. Basically when looking at the Screen Time preference pane, I get different
information depending on which device I'm looking at. My laptop will show I've
spent a certain amount of time on my laptop, iPhone, and all devices, and my
iPhone will tell me I've spent a different amount of time on my laptop, iPhone,
and all devices. Is there any way to fix this? Any ideas what's going on? I’ve
Googled and found nothing, tried restarting, tried turning screen time off and
back on, nothing.

 I know there is a setting to track across devices. If you’ve already made sure
that is on on every device I have no ideas. 
 


 I was recently looking into this... what I discovered was that on laptop it
counts any app that’s open, even if it’s in background and you are not using it.
People have asked Apple to change it, but alas, they have not. This also has
thrown a wrench into my tracking, and I have not come up with a solution yet.
(Also my stats are completely off anyway as I often have 2 devices open: laptop
displaying lecture, iPad to take notes on said lecture). 
 


 Cross device tracking is wonky so I keep my ipad and iphone screen time data
separate, not syncing across devices. 
 
"
iPhone Screen Time Code,"iPhone Screen Time Code

I've always found it annoying that you can bypass an iPhones screen time limits
simply by putting in the passcode. Thus I came up with an idea that makes it
little harder. The normal advice is to let a friend set the code so you cannot
break into it. This idea is similar, but gives you back the control and does not
rely on your friend once the code is set:  1) Use a random number generator to
create some 4-digit pin codes and save these codes (to a password manager or
something similar).  e.g. 1354 2830 8895 5426 5549 3994 7240 5955 4730 1262  2)
Get your friend to choose a random one of these 4-digit codes and set it as your
screen time passcode and that's it!  Now you can still bypass your passcode, but
there is a price to pay and that price is time. This works because after each
guess Apple imposes a time limit before you can guess again. By choosing how
many numbers there are in the list you can control (within a given range) how

 Amazing 
 
"
Starting to Lose Hope in Ever Curing my Addiction,"Starting to Lose Hope in Ever Curing my Addiction

I've been on the internet since I was 13. I'm in my 20s now, and I can't. stop.
using. my. phone.     It's with me all the time. In the bathroom, during class,
when I should be studying, at lunch with friends, watching movies.. EVERYWHERE.
I can't stop using social media or my phone no matter what I do.     It's
getting really hard to keep faith that I can actually do it, that I can reclaim
my life. I deleted tiktok off my phone, which would be great if I didn't
continue to use it on my laptop. I don't use it in class anymore, but that just
translated into watching youtube during class. Sure, it's not short form
content, but I get bored in the first minute or so and swap videos so it might
as well be.      I have tried all the apps. Opal? Deleted. ScreenZen? Deleted.
Right now, I have my boyfriend set limits on my phone and not tell me the
password, which works for instagram, but then when the limit hits I just use my
computer. I don't have an Apple computer so my screen time limits don't
transfer.     I feel hopeless, to be honest, and embarrassed that I even have to
write this. It feels so stupid to admit that a tiny device controls so much of
my life. I don't read anymore, any hobby I do must have a video on in the
background, and I'm losing touch with reality. I need some hardcore advice.
You may wonder why I haven't switched to a dumb phone, and frankly, I have
considered it. But, the modern world requires too many things a flip phone just
doesn't have. I need my banking app, my timeclock app to track my work hours,
the app to turn things in for university, Life360 to keep my parents from
worrying, maps to know where I'm going, etc.     Please, if you have advice, I
really need it. Help a girl out.

 addictions cant be turned off in a second. it takes months or years of
struggling. failing is still better than not trying at all. so keep trying. 
 


 Have you tried not bringing the laptop or phone into class? At my uni I could
rent a locker for the year and keep all my things there while I was in class.
Strictly using the library computer/lab computer instead of your own could also
help with not bringing the computer into class. Hand writing your notes might
even improve your grades.    Getting a flip phone won't help in your situation
since it's sounds like it's more of a discipline issue since you already tried
setting the limits and just move to the next available thing.    All the reasons
you mentioned (banking app, time clock app, life360) all have anolog
alternatives. Are they convenient? No absolutely not but I think that's the
trade off. Sort of like exercise its not supposed to be convenient to better
yourself.    Trust me consumerism is not a solution to your phone addiction.
There's a lot of people on the dumb phone subreddit who are still dealing with
their addictions after buying a dumb phone because ultimately it's not the phone
its you.      Apologies if none of this makes sense. I wrote everything on my
phone in one go.  
 
     i do handwrite my notes actually! it's one of the only things i've kept analog, but with my phone right
    there it's distracting so I will definitely try keeping it in my dorm while I'm in class. thank you for
    your help :))



 A dumb phone is helping me cut my phone screen time down to about 30
minutes/day. I have a light phone 2 for emergencies that only my parents,
husband, and kids have the number to. I lock my iPhone in a safe at home unless
I need it. I have a notebook that I write things down in that I need to look up
or look into during my phone time. I speed check through any apps that I need to
for the kids' sports and then put it away for the rest of the day. I won't take
it out again until night time when I'm shutting down the house or in some
circumstance where I need it (ex: I have a kid in driver's ed and they have my
iPhone number, so I'll leave it on my desk when he's out driving). Everything
else though I try to do through my computer.   It has taken me so long to find
ways to untangle myself from it and not use it. You just have to take each
individual thing and undo it one at a time. My attention span for reading is
still rough. I'm really hoping that it's salvageable. I'm getting older and I
worry that I may not have the neuroplasticity that you guys do. :( 
 


 As someone commented here already about it, try not taking the phone/computer
everywhere with you. I started leaving my phone at home when going to the gym.
Feels great to feel normal during that one and a half hour (yes, I grew up
seeing the transition of life from without internet to today).   Also, when
you're at home, try leaving the phone in another while you keep yourself busy
with your other daily activities.   For social media, I finally quit cold
turkey. If that's too difficult. Try limiting it to at first one hour a day,
preferrably at night once you're done with your tasks. Then set it to once a
week. Then if you can deactivate. I know it's tough. It took me multiple
attempts and months, over a year I think, to finally break free. But if you take
small daily steps towards it, you can make it happen.   The less you use social
media, the more you'll realize how much of it is a waste of your time and is
sapping your energy. 
 


 I have thought about this too and come up with some practices  First I will
recommend you a book called ""[Stolen Focus](https://stolenfocusbook.com/)"" by
Johann Hari. Read it or listen to it. Some of the points below i have picked up
from this book. It's kind of a long book but very informative and will help you
understand why you are so addicted.  Below are some points you can try which
have helped me.  1. Try to not always have your phone in your pocket unless
extremely inconvenient. I've personally started to put my phone in my bag when
driving to work or when going out. If i need it I will take it out and then put
it back again. Maybe you do this already since you are a girl?  2. Turn off most
notifications or at least make them silent. I only have notifications for
messages and some other apps but they are all silent. Not even vibrating. You
will probably feel some FOMO if you do this, but after a while it is very
freeing to be not be nagged all the time. Many social media apps use a lot
notifications to keep you coming back to the app.   For example when you get a
chat in snapchat you get two notifications by default. First that they are
typing and second after the message is sent. And if you are in a group chat you
even get a notification when somebody reacts to a message that wasn't even
yours. Why do we need that? It is the same with snapchat streaks. The real
reason for that feature is to get users to open the app every day.  3. When you
don't want to use your phone put it somewhere you can't see it (in a bag or
drawer for example). If you just put it straight in front of you you will just
keep being reminded it's there.  4. Go outside for a walk without your phone or
music. Walk slowly, slower than you usually do. It will help your brain calm
down. Maybe sit down on a bench too for a little. This can be applied to almost
anything. Just by doing things slower your brain can hit the brakes a little. (I
read about this in a book called ""[The Ruthless Elimination of
Hurry](https://www.amazon.com/Ruthless-Elimination-Hurry-Emotionally-
Spiritually/dp/0525653090)"")  5. Don't rely on your phone for everything. You
already take notes on pen and paper. See what else you can replace. Example: Pay
with a card instead of your phone, write shopping lists on paper, listen to CDs
instead of streaming music.   6. Try grayscale mode  7. Have a routine for
*real* relaxation. You might think that watching a movie or tv series is a way
to relax and it is, but only for your body. Your brain is still working hard
when doing stuff like that. Try sitting or lying down and don't do anything for
5-10 minutes. You can increase this after you get used to it. This will also
help your brain calm down.  I hope this wall of text isn't too much for you :P 
 


 Stop taking your phone everywhere with you.    Delete all the apps from it.  
 


 Don't just delete the apps from your phone, or put easily bypassed limits on
your apps. Delete/close your accounts altogether. Have your boyfriend change the
passwords then close the account so you can't just re-open them in 30 days or
whatever. That was literally the only thing that helped me get off twitter.
> feel hopeless, to be honest, and embarrassed that I even have to write this
Don't be embarrassed. These companies have spent millions if no billions of
dollars figuring out how to keep us hooked on their shitty products. 
 


 Please, don't lose hope. I've been addicted for six years but have been finally
able to cure my internet addiction. It's possible. I've sent you a DM with
further advice 
 


 Watch the social dilemma on Netflix. It's the people who created the algorithms
and they talk about why it's so addictive, etc. it really helped me frame the
""why"" of wanting to quit social media 
 


 I think the best thing you can do in your situation at first is to mute ALL APPS
notifications. And turn your screen to grayscale. This should help you at first.
Do some activities that you can't do using your phone like cleaning and cooking
and sports etc.. What really helped me was my nostalgia for old days when ppl
used to sit together and chatting not like this day everyone on his phone. Even
when I try to sit with my family I find no one to chat with they all on their
phone, my friends as well. So I decided to break the circle of phone addiction.

The Joy of Screen-Free Walking 🌲☀️,"The Joy of Screen-Free Walking 🌲☀️

Hey r/digitalminimalism !  One of my favorite screen-free activities is to
**WALK WITHOUT MY PHONE**.   Of course I love mobile music (see prior posts!),
but there is something about the sound of silence paired with movement that our
society has lost value of. I cannot explain the radiance of energy that it
creates in me!   **Screen-Free Walking Requirements:**  * *No Phone* * *No
Music* * *No AirPods or Headphones* * *No Podcast* * *No Audiobook* * *MOST
importantly- NO SOCIAL MEDIA!!*   **Screen-Free Walking Activities:** ""Ah... So
what am I supposed to do?""  * *Smile and talk to people! :)* * *Pet dogs and
animals (with permission)* * *Listen to the birds and the wind* * *See the
things you normally don't take time to see* * *Ponder the deeper things in life*
I recently went for a 10 mile walk following this formula. WOW! It is such a
force multiplier to the feeling you get from a long walk alone. I see people
everyday out walking or running, but their heads are buried in the feeds.
Agonizing over whatever the algorithm decided to pop, versus looking up at the
beauty and harmony around them. I want so badly to help people experience what I
have!  Now more than ever, everyone – not just our digital minimalist community
– could benefit from some screen-free time. While non of my family or friends
are in ""our group,"" all agree they would benefit from getting time offline and
off social media. Let's figure out ways to share a ""taste"" of what we are all
living via digital minimalism to the masses!  **Questions: Do you have a similar
scree-free routine for restoration and renewal? Do you do it alone? If there was
a ""screen-free walking"" group in your community, would you join?**  *PS - Yes, I
still wore my Apple Watch to track the workout, hence the post activity
screenshot. Apple Watch settings: 1) DND/Focus mode enabled, 2) ""raise to wake""
and ""always on"" display settings disabled (this is key) 3) All app notification
off! 🤓⌚️*

 Did you mean to create a literal abstract outline of a person holding a phone?
Also, good for you!! I used to walk & run all the time outside. Then two+ yrs
straight of bad news constantly sent me into deep depression woot woot - gained
20lbs and now I have high cholesterol 🫥 
 
     Holy smokes I never saw that until you mentioned it! Thank you so much. Walking is the best thing for
    mental and physical health. I started with small 1-2 milers, then eventually built up. Sending you metta
    loving kindness and best wishes for healthy times ahead!



 My in-laws live right there, some great walking in that area! 
 
     amazing walking!



 This is wildly impressive 
 
     Thank you so much! ;)



 Now everyone knows where you live😬 
 
     Nahhhhh all we know is they live in Minneapolis, a very populous city lmao



 How long was your journey? 
 
     About 3 hours for the 10.6 miles! :)

How do you actually cut down phone time without deleting everything?,"How do you actually cut down phone time without deleting everything?

I've been trying to reduce my phone usage, but deleting apps feels too extreme
and I always reinstall them anyway. I've tried Apple's Screen Time but theres a
lot of frustration given at how it takes an EXTREME approach to blocking apps.
Has anyone had luck building up gradual habits to overcome this friction to
cutting down phone time?

 Ok so its not just me! What tripped me up was going too hard, too fast. I'd
delete Instagram or set a 30-minute cap, then get frustrated and scrap the whole
thing. The only thing that worked was easing into it.... so I started with 10
opens a day, then gradually lowered it to 5, then 3. That way it felt like
training a muscle, not punishing myself. Jomo made this easier because you can
set daily ""open limits"" and adjust over time, instead of just slamming the door
shut on yourself. 
 


 Address the USER INTERFACE. Switch to a minimalist home screen. Put your screen
time as a widget on that home screen. Silence unnecessary notifications. Turn on
""reduce motion"" and ""dark mode"" in settings. Get an app blocker like Opal
instead of apple's default one. Our phones are designed with addiction and
dependency in mind, but you can change that. Reframe your phone as a productive
device, not a distracting one. 
 
     Can't agree more - addressing your user interface is key. A minimalist launcher such as Dumbify (for
    iPhone) to cut down on Home Screen distractions helped me immensely.



 I deleted the apps but use the web versions on my laptop which is much less
addicting and easier to stop 
 


 I put my phone in black and white. Makes everything far more boring 
 


 put. your. phone. down.  I got a 'landline' courdless phone with a base and a
couple of handsets. Phone charges next to it and connects bluetooth when im at
home. Can make and receive calls on the handsets through my phone.   Build
healthier habbits. Dont look at the phone at all in the morning for an amount of
time. Learn to read again, especially at night. Use the black and white settings
to decrease the dopamine from the phone. Your body craves the dopamine hits from
the phone, it will take time to relearn to get dopamine from other places. 
 
     what is this landline phone called?



 Nothing happens if nothing happens.  Until you delete the accounts along with
the apps, it's highly unlikely you'll break the addictive dopamine cycle when
access to the thing you're trying not to use is a greased chute back into using
it. 
 


 Access the apps only on desktop which is normally at work and delete them from
mobile 
 


 Instead of focusing on less screen time, focus on actual in person activities
that you like. Make more plans, do more crafts, read books, take classes, go and
live your life. 
 


 You just have to break the flow and you will have the control back in your
hands. Try app timers, they are surprisingly good. There are many like,
screenzen, apppause, appblock, TimerX. All do the job just fine in helping you
regain control. I use timerx as it has a great feature of reminding me of my
tasks and all before each app open, so thats what I use daily. 
 


 I tried, I couldn’t do it. The human brain of these days is rotten because of
all the scrolling apps. This is why I had to start using Opal, to block my
screen time. Even the free version does the job for me. It not as easy to
override. It did the job and I’m scrolling a whole lot less. Just trying to
achieve this by habits I think is as hard as losing weight or coming of drugs,
simply by will power. You need some tools or help to get you on the right track.

smart phone that isn’t smart (but not dumb) Please help.,"smart phone that isn’t smart (but not dumb) Please help.

Putting the dumb phone tag cause it’s related but it’s not exact. Just hear me
out. This is a very long explanation but I promise it’s relevant. **TLDR** at
the end.  Hi everyone. Getting straight to the point. I have a terrible phone
addiction. I’m talking 7-10 plus hours a day when I’m not at work and this has
been going on for the better part of a decade. I am one of those people that
grew up on the internet, and I started heavily using it around age 10 and it’s
been a daily part of my life ever since, so I guess you could say it’s a bit of
an internet addiction as well that’s been going on for around 15 years.   Guys I
am miserable. My attention span is shot. I have no hobbies. I am always tired. I
cannot bring myself to do anything but open apps even if I am not interested in
it. What’s crazy is I’m not even getting the same enjoyment or time usage out of
these apps anymore either. I lost access to my Tik tok account and haven’t
redownloaded it. I’ve barely used instagram for the last six years because I
simply don’t like it. Hardly use twitter anymore because that went to shit. I
can only bring myself to watch YouTube shorts cause I can’t pay attention to
long format videos. I don’t play games. I mainly use Reddit for advice (I know
taking advice from randos online is risky but I have truly found a lot of help
from communities on here).   So I went from using Twitter, safari, YouTube,
Reddit etc for upwards of 10 hours a day to maybe 15 minutes - an hour because I
became exhausted. And that has improved my mental health a lot, but I still have
issues. My addiction is so bad it’s just impossible to put this down. It’s
instinctual and I can’t stop it. I won’t even text or read or post on the few I
still have. I’ll just keep opening them and closing them over and over again for
hours because the habit is so ingrained in me after years of doing it, and when
I’m not doing that I’m sleeping or staring off into space waiting for something
to entertain me.   I can feel my brain cells dying. My vocabulary and spelling
is awful. My mood is always down. My anhedonia is through the damn room and I
don’t leave the house unless it’s necessary or it’s to meet up with someone
else. I know my phone is central to all this because I used to be an extremely
creative person that enjoyed art and games and reading but now I do none of it
because it’s like I can’t be bothered.   The problem is not having a smart phone
in this day and age is next to impossible. I have thought about going nuclear
and getting a flip phone but they are so bare bones it would cause more problems
than issues, and we don’t have the cool Japanese ones in the US. I’ve tried
ScreenZen but it doesn’t work well with my life because my schedule is so
inconsistent that I can’t set up consistent time limits and at the end of the
day it’s still an app I can delete. I’ve deleted others but always just
downloaded them again because I don’t have discipline. Tried gray scale for 24
hours and despised it so I turned it off. I have next to zero self control so
dumbing down my current iPhone **does NOT work** because I have no discipline.
So I do not want advice on just “make it less interesting to look at.” Giving it
to someone and telling them to not give it to me is not feasible as a 26 yo. I
am looking into things like Android debloat or Shizuku but I’m still not quite
sure how they work and I need a new phone for that.   **So Summary/TLDR: I need
a cell phone that is still smart enough for daily life but highly inconvenient
or boring to use. Whether that means debloating, less storage, making apps hard
to access, etc. Not so dumb that I can’t have any modern apps but not the same
exact phone that I just need better self control to use. I am looking to switch
away from Apple so anything that isn’t them. I know this all sounds conflicting
but if there’s ANYTHING tell me. Please help me, I have lost years of my life to
this device I fear I’m going to lose the rest of it if I don’t stop.**

 We may need more details on what apps you actually, really truly need. I had
very similar issues you're having. I switched to the Light Phone III. There's
been some pain points, but I'm managing, and my mental health has been better. I
keep my old iPhone powered off in a storage tote under my bed, so if I really
need it for something I can use it. But I haven't truly needed it since I
switched. But your needs may be different.  What apps do you actually need to
have on a phone? What features? And I mean really need. 
 
     Maps, Gmail, Spotify (I know it sounds silly but I have 11 years worth of music on there), preferably
    discord (I have a lot of friends that I can only communicate to through that app).



 flip phone is expensive. just buy the cheap phone with 2GB RAM or 32GB storage
you cannot run too many apps on there lol 
 
     Idk if I’m bad at looking but it seems impossible to find a phone that is as low as 32 gigs now



 I think you need to visit r/dumbphones for some good phone recommendations.   In
regards to the addiction, it sounds like you need a circuit breaker. Maybe you
need to go on a holiday, say a camping trip where it's just you and nature so
you can get the break from screens that you're really after. 
 


 honestly i went flip phone for every day use-cingular flex 2. i do have a laptop
i use and 99% of apps are available online in web form. laptop is how i do all
my banking. i got rid of all social media except reddit. i dont carry my laptop
with me, only use it at home. i have no issues with having a flip phone and
laptop. flip phone does have google, google maps and a browser u can use in a
pinch. hope this helps. 
 


 Hi! So I get you, first and foremost, and you are not alone on the struggle. I
have spent hundreds to thousands of dollars on this issue and I have some
advice.   1) If you have a job that requires you to use apps like Outlook,
Gmail, and other general stuff like that, get the Unihertz Atom. It has a 2.5
inch not great (but not terrible) screen that works well enough to access apps
but YouTube isn’t the same. It has a finger print scanner, pretty waterproof,
4G, very very little bloat. It has access to the addictive apps, but it’s small
enough to discourage any prolonged use of them.  I’ll do a longer Reddit review
when I get the chance.   Also, check out the Apple Watch. That’s what I use as
my daily driver for call and text. It’s nice because it’s still in the apple
ecosystem, it has Siri to do tasks like call and text, can provide directions,
listen to music, etc. It has less capabilities with regard to phone apps, but
it’s a nice alternative.   Also, if your creative space is writing, I recommend
trying fountain pens or getting a r/writerDeck from Un Kyu Lee. I have a Micro
Journal I bought from him and it is a single purpose writing device that only
makes txt files that you can send to your computer. I love the ability to draft
my thoughts without touching a smartphone, but not needing to worry about the
though vanishing before I get pen to paper.   If you have any questions feel
free to respond and I’ll be happy to answer! 
 
     Thank you so much!!! :)



 If the advice like deleting the social media apps and turning your phone into
black and white doesn’t help, then I don’t think it’s the phone.  I think you
need human connection. A hug, someone to go to. Somewhere to do physical
exercise with people.    You also said that when you come home from work, you
can only scroll. That means you’re so overstimulated from working that your
brain needs to rest. You need meditation, not more stimulation.   The things
that have helped me are EFT tapping, yoga, meditation and journaling. I also
like to read books. 
 


 Do you have a Macbook? You can route all of your calls/texts through your
MacBook and lock up your iphone in a lock box (Walmart sells them in the office
section). Put the keys away somewhere else. I have mine in another box in a
drawer just so it's annoying to get to. As long as your phone is on, all the
calls/texts will be able to go through to your computer.  Buy a dumb phone, (I
have the light phone 2) put it on Mint mobile for $15/month. Give the dumb phone
number to the 5-6 people your are closest with. Immediate family, best friend,
etc for emergencies. This is your new daily carry. Everyone with your main
number you can respond to whenever through the computer. Not everyone needs to
be able to connect with you all day.  Only take your iPhone out when you really
need it. Concert tickets, a long road trip, etc. I had to use mine today to get
into my son's football game. I scanned the ticket and turned it off. Try to
start living most of your day/week without it.  This is the only thing that has
worked for me so far. It took us a long time to integrate these things so deeply
into our lives, it's going to take some time to untangle it. Be easy on
yourself. I'm trying to give myself a full year. 
 


 check out thekaizenapp, it basically blocks all distracting apps and it can't be
deleted. it's a good alternative to a dumbphone because it uses the smartphone
you already have

the universe has given me a sign to stop,"the universe has given me a sign to stop

Like a lot of gen z, my friends and I talk from time to time about just getting
rid of our iphones and getting flip phones. We always agree that it would make
life so much more simple and meaningful. We all know the effects of our phones
and social media and we all want to do something about it, but as addictions go,
it's not quite that simple. In the last two weeks, I have found myself picking
up my phone a lot more than normal, catching myself scrolling for no reason,
getting very overwhelmed by politics on my phone. I work at a news station, so I
am surrounded by politics 50% of my life anyways. I am always torn between
thinking I need to know what trump is doing to change our lives every day, and
knowing how incredibly anxious it makes me. I've thought about removing news
notifications from my phone after work hours to give my brain a break, my
boyfriend was very relieved at the idea, hating how much power it has over my
mental wellbeing.   Then, over the last week or so, my phone's battery has
started bugging out, worsening every day until the last few days when it would
only allow me to use it when it was plugged in constantly and dying every few
minutes, even at 100%. I took off my phone case off and realized my battery was
swollen and making my screen bulge. My boyfriend told me I should stop charging
it or at least make sure it didn't get hot, it could be dangerous. So yesterday,
I only plugged in my phone when I needed to use it for something. After work, I
went to the apple store and talked to an employee about getting a battery
replacement and showed her. She literally gasped. The store was closing early
because today is the new phone launch (go figure), and she said she didn't have
time to do it but she did not want me using that phone. She left to talk to
someone, when she came back she said it would cost me $200 to get it replaced
and that I should just buy a new one instead, the second half exactly what I was
expecting them to say. I told her I would make an appointment online later, and
when I left the store, I felt this incredible sense of relief. Like a weight had
lifted off my shoulders. I smiled the whole short car ride home.   I've been
mulling over what to do next in my head since last night. What I know right now
is, I am NOT buying a new phone. And I'll be waiting until at least Sunday to
get it fixed, giving myself the weekend without it. I debated getting a flip
phone, and though I would be able to brag to my friends I was the first one
brave enough to do it, I don't think I will. As much as iphones are a hindrance
to mental health, they are still, undoubtedly, an incredible tool. A tool I
intend to make smarter use of. When I get my phone fixed, whenever I decide to
do it, I am going to delete all forms of social media, games, and mindless apps.
I have an ipad, so I will keep those things on there, but my ipad does not sit
in my purse or pocket all day, every day. I won't be able to just pull it out
whenever I feel oncoming boredom. I'm definitely going to keep spotify and
reddit, and I'm debating on keeping youtube.   So I digress, I've decided this
was my sign. I just turned 20, and I have no reason to waste any more years of
my life glued to a rectangular box like a zombie. Time has only moved faster as
the years go on, and I need to grab onto moments before they're gone. I realized
years ago that the ladder half of my life, I've spent distracted. The childhood
living room I used to play board games and make crafts in when I was little, I
spent sitting with my family, all separately on our phones. Precious childhood
time wasted, and I can never get that back. But I can take back the rest of my
life. And I intend to. This post will hold me accountable as well. I don't want
to live like this anymore. Cheers to the rest of my life, actually living!

 Bravo that you have arrived at this place so young. I grew up in the 90s so
remember a childhood without social media, but since my early 20s I’ve been
hooked to my smart phone. I’ve deleted most social media recently and only have
kept a few apps. Really hoping to reclaim all the lost time too. Best of luck
with this journey. I hope you’re friends follow suit :) 
 
     Thank you bunches, that's sweet. Best of luck to you too, we'll get there for sure :)



 You could check out the Light Phone, or the Wisephone. My family has had good
experiences with both. 
 
     Thanks for the suggestion!!



 I lost my phone a week ago and now I don't want to replace it. I feel like
myself without it. My mind already feels healthier and my thought processes feel
more in my control. Considering a simple or flip phone. But I rely a lot on apps
like Transit (for public transit live info), Uber/Lyft, Spin (for scooters), and
banking. So, I'm also going to be mulling over my options this weekend. 
 


 My smartphone was purchased in 2018.  When it dies, I will not be replacing it.
I have Lightphone which I love.  I hope your generation collectively changes the
use of smartphones for the better.  The current political climate makes it
easier to want to disconnect.   Best wishes.

"After Years of Mindless Scrolling, I Finally Reclaimed My Focus and Mindfulness","After Years of Mindless Scrolling, I Finally Reclaimed My Focus and Mindfulness

I’ve always been productive and focused , including long periods where I
meditated daily and journaled consistently.  But over the past few years, I fell
into constant phone use, especially YouTube.  It wasn’t just a few videos , it
was non-stop:  * Watching while working out, walking, when watching TV with my
partner or even brushing my teeth * No quiet moments, ever * Always reaching for
my phone for a “hit” of something  I had already deleted social media apps years
ago, but YouTube remained a constant distraction.  Most days, I was hitting 3–4
hours of screen time on my phone. Worse than the hours was the habit — endless
reaching for my phone without any good reason, doomscrolling Amazon, and daily
PS5 gaming without real enjoyment.  A few weeks ago, I finally said: enough but
funnily enough, it all started when I joined this subreddit.  I originally came
here because I’ve always been pretty intentional with my tech. I’m the kind of
person who believes every tool or device I own should have a specific,
meaningful reason to exist in my life.  But reading through the posts here, I
realised that most people weren’t just optimising tech, they were trying to
escape tech addiction.  It inspired me to do better — not just with my tools,
but with how I live.  # What I Changed:  * Deleted YouTube from my phone * Set
my phone to grayscale — **GAME CHANGER** — my phone feels so boring now * Only
use my phone for communicating with friends, family, and work * Leave my phone
at home or keep it tucked away in a drawer when not needed * Restricted gaming
and YouTube to weekends only * Moved browsing and task-related apps from my
phone to my MacBook * I bought a **Supernote Manta** (e-ink notebook) about a
month ago — now I spend much more time thinking and creating rather than
consuming. No dopamine traps, just calm focus.  # The Results (in two weeks):  *
Finished two books and I am half way on the third one (usually two books would
take me at best a month) * Became more productive and present — at work, with my
partner, and at the gym * Stopped mindless dopamine chasing * Felt genuinely
calm and clear-headed for the first time in awhile * **Became mindful of how,
every time I grab my phone to do something specific, it immediately tries to
steal my focus, and how I now catch it and pull my attention back to what I was
meant to do**  Moving Forward my phone is now just for communication — family,
friends, and work.  I’m considering switching to a cellular Apple Watch to leave
my phone behind completely outside work hours.  Reclaiming my attention has felt
like reclaiming my life.  The difference in focus, calm, and energy is night and
day.  **Thank you for inspiring me and for all the tips that I read in this
subreddit, it helped me a lot!**  [Screen Time](https://preview.redd.it/7eo2zih1

 > Set my phone to gray-scale  Man, it's crazy how effective this is. I find it
easy to spot a lot of the tricks UI / UX designers use to make their apps as
addictive as possible, but color is such an easy one to forget about, but it's
so powerful.   Sounds like you've had a massive improvement already, just keep
doing it! 
 
     [deleted]

     Also just FYI, you can set your phone to sleep mode so that it goes into greyscale at a certain time every
    day. I love it.

     Thank you!  I actually learned about it from another post here.  At first, I thought it wouldn’t be
    realistic to keep my iPhone in grayscale, but now I’m used to it.  It genuinely makes me reach for it far
    less and honestly, if I stay consistent, it’ll probably help me keep this phone much longer before feeling
    the need to replace it.  I did set up a button shortcut to quickly switch back to colour if needed, for
    example, the other day I was trying to show a few photos to some people, and grayscale wasn’t ideal.



 Congratulations, I'm still on the journey 
 
     Thank you! Being here and *aware of the issue* is already half the battle.



 I am doing this now. Someone check in on me in two weeks. 
 
     I put a reminder!

     How is it going?:)

Exactly how I minimized my Reddit page to be VERY BORING,"Exactly how I minimized my Reddit page to be VERY BORING

I got rid of my smartphone and all my social medias quite a while ago, but a
couple weeks ago, I made this Reddit account because I was missing a platform to
talk about a few things that no one else in my real life was interested in
talking about: digital minimalism and freshwater aquarium fish. If you look at
my account, you can see that all I do is write paragraphs and paragraphs about
those topics. It has really helped me reflect on them and refine my knowledge.
However, it is important to me that I do not fall into the rabbit hole that’s so
accessible here.  ***Digital minimalism: I will only use this technology in ways
that benefit me. I will not use it in any ways that do not benefit me. I — an
individual who is prone to addictions and obsessions — will take measures to
ensure that these boundaries stay in place.***  Here are the steps I took to do
this. I spent $4 (on an optional step) and a few hours of tinkering around to
figure out which tools worked best. This is all on Safari, since I'm on a Mac,
but both Chrome and Safari support all of the extensions I used.  1. **Delete
Reddit from all devices except your computer.**     * This is a huge step for
many, so I understand if this doesn’t work for others for some type of reason.
For me, I already did not have a phone and only use my computer for access to
the internet.    * If you are struggling with this, reconsider your boundaries
with the app. Reddit is not for doomscrolling. It is a discussion forum or an
occasional reference for niche things. Reddit is a mix of long form and short
form content. You are here for the long form, which can be much more
educational. Now with that in mind, it makes sense to reserve Reddit for a
computer, where you can lay out, type, and read long forum posts with a real
keyboard and a large screen. For example, I’m typing this post in a word
document. A phone is simply not suitable for this type of thing. The only thing
a phone could ever offer for Reddit is doomscrolling. 2. **Leave all Reddits
that are not essential to you.**     * Again, a hard thing, but which ones
really benefit you? Which ones are you actually there to participate and discuss
in and not just to quietly lurk and consume? Again, Reddit is not for scrolling.
It is a forum for discussion. I won’t be in any subreddit that I don’t feel like
I’m very actively participating in (hence the username!).     * Once you’ve
finished this step, you’ve done all the hard parts. The rest is downhill… 3.
**Adjust your Reddit account settings.**    * Preferences tab:       *
Recommendations in home feed OFF       * Default feed view COMPACT    * I
personally turned messages off entirely, since I did not come here to message
privately, only to write forum posts. 4. **Switch to old Reddit.**     * Old
Reddit appears more boring than New Reddit.    * If you are not already on Old
Reddit, switching will make you feel like you’re in a new place, which will more
easily bring about a new mindset about Reddit.    * Old Reddit is also easier
for executing the following steps.    * In the slightly different preferences
there,        * “compress the link display” (Displays your feed as JUST words
and nothing else)       * “display 25 links at once” (You don’t need to see 50
or more)       * “sort comments by new” (Best for forming your own opinions) 5.
**Download the browser extension UBlock Origin Lite.**    * This is an ad and
content blocker. I swear by it. It is the highlight of this entire process. 6.
**Create dozens and dozens “custom filters.”**    * By selecting the UBlock’s
custom filter option, you can literally just select the buttons and pieces that
you don’t ever want to see again. From there on, every time you visit the
website, it will be as though those things never even existed. If you mess up,
select “remove a custom filter.” It’s annoying, but you only have to do this a
few times. I want to mention again that I cannot believe an app this useful is
free. This app is the star of the show.    * Here’s some of the many things I
chose to filter out, sort of in order from top left to bottom right, which can
hopefully be (not) seen in the attached images:       * “Get New Reddit”       *
“Home - Popular - All - Users”       * “Ask Reddit - Pics - Funny - Movies”
* “Edit”       * The entire left expandable sidebar       * All of the tabs:
“Best”, “Hot”, “New”, “Rising”, “Controversial”, “Top”, “Wiki”       * The chat
icon (if you turned off messages, too)       * The notifications icon       *
“Preferences” (if you ever need these again, just go to
[www.reddit.com/prefs](http://www.reddit.com/prefs). Easy to remember. Won’t be
needed enough to have its very own button.)       * The numbers numbering each
of the posts       * The Reddit Premium advertisement       * “Create your own
subreddit”       * The entire “Recently viewed links” panel       * The entire
bottom footer that includes “about”, “help”, “apps & tools”, etc.    * These are
all things that I deemed annoying and/or completely useless to me. The goal is
to keep ONLY the things that are relevant. 7. **Default every Reddit feed to
sort by “New” and not “Best.”**     * We did this earlier for comments in the
settings. This is important because sorting by “Best” or “Hot” or “Trending”
gives you posts and comments that are reinforced by other peoples opinions. You
need to form your own opinions. The number of upvotes is so small on Old Reddit,
that ideally, you will read the comment or post before having a sense of how
popular it is. And when you respond to a post, it will be one of the first
responses on the post, which is more likely to spark a real discussion with the
original poster.    * Download Redirect Web. I paid a one-time price of $4 to
have more than 1 redirect. You can decide whether or not more than one is worth
it to you. I use this extension to automatically redirect away from
recommendation pages on other sites as well, so for me it was.    * REDIRECT 1:
The main Reddit page. (Most important)       * FROM:
[https://www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) (in Wildcard)       * TO:
[www.reddit.com/new](http://www.reddit.com/new)    * REDIRECT 2: Any subreddit
page.       * FROM: \^https:\\/\\/www\\.reddit\\.com\\/r\\/(\[\^\\/\]+)\\/?$ (in
Regex)       * TO:
[https://www.reddit.com/r/$1/new](https://www.reddit.com/r/$1/new) 8.
\[OPTIONAL\] Because Old Reddit does not offer dark mode, I have found that the
free Safari extension “Nightshift” does a good job. This was made specifically
for Mac's Safari, but there are so many other free browser extensions out there
that do the same thing.  Now, if I didn’t miss any important steps, your Reddit
should be just as boring as mine. You can apply these same steps to Instagram,
Youtube, and more.  BE BORED! BE FREE!  The aforementioned images:  https://prev

 It's very interesting to see another point of view! And actually, what a good
POV you have!   I've always thought about reddit as a social media app in the
sense, that became popular nowadays. I have always been a “spectator” on reddit,
I mean I was just consuming. I have never thought about reddit as a discussion
forum.  I've never wrote comments or posts on reddit, cuz I hadn't understood
what do I need it for. You know, people will still discuss stuff, if I won't
write anything. And I will still get to know topics that I'm interested in.
Guys who are writing much on reddit, what makes you write? What sparks you to
share opinions? What feelings do you experience from it?  Sorry for my english,
I am not an English-speaking person

My Minimalist iPhone 13 mini Setup,"My Minimalist iPhone 13 mini Setup

I finally have time to share my minimalist iPhone setup with you. Took more
pictures but the subreddit does not allow galleries.  Key features:   \- iPhone
13 mini (128 GB, 88% battery health) that I am often using the wired Apple
headphones.   \- Empty gray home screen (no apps, trying to hide the (empty)
dock as much as possible). --> screenshot   \- Kept the phone on iOS 17 with the
help of the beta program, not actually a developer or beta tester.   \- Overall
setup limited to most essential apps (24, in my case) that I access mostly via
search or App Library.   \- Special setup with Focus modes (DnD, Relax and Work
mode are automatically activated via different schedules to fit my work, sleep
and time off rhythm. Have different lock screens to limit distractions and while
keeping productivity up.   \- I use Scheduled Summary to bundle the few
remaining notifications (like for banking, etc.) into 3 timed summaries per day.
\- Have automations set up (no screenshot) to activated Color Filters for
grayscale mode and Low Battery Mode when below 35%.  This overall setup works
great for me and keeps my screen time to about 43m average per day.  Let me know
if you have additional ideas or questions. I am curious to see how other
minimalists have set up their devices!

 OP thinks that they can be a true minmalist while still having a phone.
*And* battery that's over 50%? A true minimalist would ***never*** have more
than 5%. Use the KonMarie method and declutter your life OP       /s 
 
     You're a funny guy! I am actually super happy with how my phone turned out. Working on my minimalist
    approach not to comply with any standards, other than my own ideas and opinions.  Have a great
    day...whether your battery is at 5 or 55%!



 Black, white, AND gray all on the same screen?? A little too maximalist for me. 
/s  Nice calm setup, OP! 
 
     Finding and tweaking a wallpaper to hide the color of the dock is quite challenging. Tried different
    version, but it depends on transparency on/off, dark mode, etc. whether it really works out in the end.



 I think you should consider a wallpaper color that makes the dock disappear. 
 
     Yes, 100%. This is what I wanted. Tried to use the wallpapers from this website
    (https://heyeased.weebly.com) but some of my settings do not align with their requirements. For example, I
    want to keep 'reduce transparency' on for my phone.

     Does someone have another source for black and light gray wallpapers that hide the dock?



 ![gif](giphy|3oEhmXBdJsH9oBajZK) 
 


 Too maximizing, hard to focus. 
 
     Will see how I can minimize it some more…. /s

Screen-free pedometer that's not an Oura ring?,"Screen-free pedometer that's not an Oura ring?

Hello!  I currently have an apple watch but I tend to have it on sleep mode most
of the time, so it feels like a waste.  I'm trying to cut down on screens in all
areas of my life, but I love tracking my steps.  Can anyone recommend me a
screen-free pedometer for counting steps?  I'm not keen on the Oura ring as my
weight tends to fluctuate and my fingers aren't a consistent enough size to take
the plunge on a ring that expensive when all I really want to know is my daily
step count!  Ideally looking for something without a screen but that I can
connect to my phone step counter app.  Thanks for reading!  edit: I'm a woman so
open to lots of different styles

 Polar Loop! 
 


 I know it’s not exactly screen-free but as devices go, the fitbit Inspire is
relatively analog. The screen is black and white and pretty hard to see, and it
mostly functions as a watch. I recommend it for the minimal lifestyle for sure 
 


 I wish someone would make something new like the Misfit Ray. I got a surprising
number of compliments on my nice bracelet. Little did they know it also counted
steps and buzzed for specific notifications. 
 


 I'm interested! I have exactly the same problem! 
 


 The Amazfit Helio Strap might be what you're looking for. 
 


 Following.  I loved the Fitbit Flex 2, it was just a step counter that synced
with your phone. No screens and it would light up when you hit your goal. Then
Fitbit stopped offering support for it and it stopped working. Also, now the
Fitbits all have screens.  
 


 You may like the Garmin vivomove. It's an analog watch with secret health
tracking.

At last... my solution to digital distraction.,"At last... my solution to digital distraction.

So, man, I've tried everything.  Background, I have a small contracting
business.  A family of 5.  Live on a nice homestead.  Living the dream, it
seems, except for...  Digital addiction.  Yup, got that right.  My problem was
news- any sort of news-y distraction.  It was pocket induced brain cancer.  Get
bored, pull out my phone.  A little jittery, out she comes.  Name or fact on the
tip of my tongue... yoink!  I couldn't just give it away- the phone, I mean.  My
phone was my lifeline to customers, and texting, email and calls are how I do
business. Communication is key. No phone, no comms, no sales, no money... and it
all washes down into the toilet.  Tried Freedom App, tried minimalist phone
app...etc.  Tried a flip phone (TCL flip), a retro Nokia, and even put the Light
Phone into my basket, until I realized it wasn't shipping until November.
Android, in particular, made it real easy to get around hard limits on screen
use, and even the Freedom App, locked down, could be easily defeated by shutting
of the WiFi.  So, about a month ago, I ordered an Apple SE2022 from Amazon for
200.00.  Never had an iPhone  before.  Had my wife set an iCloud Password, and a
Screentime Password to lock down the phone and told her never to give it to me.
Ever.  On pain of... well, just don't.  Screentime password and iCloud password
in the hands of someone else, hidden somewhere in the house.  Then, I deleted
the App Store, the Safari Browser, and only had a few apps that aren't really
addictive.  Mail. Messaging. Garmin. Phone- I mean, really, Maps and Notes and
Contacts are super-useful. Especially for a small business owner.  Verdit - I'm
averaging about 40 minutes per day on my phone, now, all business related.  The
phone itself is just kind of BORING, which is a good thing.  I'd rather read Dog
Man to my 7 year old then scan the internet obsessively, mindlessly,
addictively... as my finite time in this world pines away.    That morning
routine I wanted to establish for years now just happens because... I'm bored.
I pay Warhammer table top with my boys because... I'm bored.  I go on a morning
walk because... I'm bored.  Feed the livestock at sunrise because... I'm bored
(and they'd starve to death, but I'm just way more on it).  Anyway, so it felt
pretty good.  Business is still humming along, and if I need the internet, I sit
down at my desk, wait a minute for it to boot up, open a browser, waste a bunch
or a bit of time (usually way less now), and then get off it, and go be bored
(and in being bored, do more interesting things).  So, yeah.  Good luck.  My
advice- get the iPhone, have someone you trust (and can't manipulate) lock it
down, accept the locked down phone rather than weasel-ing a way around its
limitations, and then get back to living.  We're not meant to live in the
simulacrum."
"Hi, I'm Maria and I'm also struggling with phone addiction","Hi, I'm Maria and I'm also struggling with phone addiction

So, hi everyone. This is my very first post (sorry for my English BTW).  I
decided to write my journey so far becauuse I read a lot of stories here and how
people overcame their digital addiction or the way how they made a down-to-earth
decision on their 21 hour-screen-time. At the end I learned. But it has been 2
years. And the fact that ""you are free from your phone"" is not real, instead you
will see it as a tool, and that is the objective seeing a smartphone: as a tool.
I also learned that nothing comes out of a sudden because we have to work on
progression, like in music. If you're on a band you know that we need to
practice individually and in group, and even in sub-groups if things are nor
getting better (like winds on a side, strings on other side and so) and then all
together because a great presentation doesn't come from the bushes it comes from
practice, making an effort to do it, taking responsibility and action knowing
that it will in the long term help, but we're sooo tight to our phones that we
think everything is instant and we no longer take advantage of the small steps
we make and see it as fail and then go back and see ourselves glued to screens
again and then wishing we would be able to un-glue from the phone and a sick
cycle rounds and all start again. But what we don't see is that phones are built
to take our attention, all of our time, well the few time we have left, and we
don't see that it is not our fault. [It is not our fault to be
glued.](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053758/phone-addictive-design-google-
apple)  It was two years ago when I came to notice about ""attention span"" and I
didn't fully understand it; also how screentime affected the eyes and so on SO I
said, ok that's me. I like to watch YouTube videos regarding ""productivity"",
""how to get rid of your phone"" the-like-videos and all that kind of stuff, and I
came across a video (well It was an interview) of [Dr
Suzuki](https://www.wendysuzuki.com/) and how social media affected our brains
and that the brain shrinks, and I was like WHAT!! and I guess *that* was the
time I realized something didn't matched. However I kept on watching YT, I also
used to watch ""Study WIth Me"" videos to focus, but it was actually to not to get
out of my confort zone ***(!)*** so at the end the algorithim showed me those
typpes of videos but that made me think that **I was** *still* **glued to the
screen**... ugh f!k!   Ok, so basically even though I had IG and Pin and YT, I
decided to make my phone **less appealing.** And to make it ugly for me I
learned it from Cal Newport on their [podcast](https://calnewport.com/). I even
thought about getting a dumbphone but I really need those banking apps, my email
and maps. I didn't delete my accounts, instead I uninstalled it from my phone as
I did with IG and Pin, and disable YT, and if I wanted to scroll I had to use my
laptop and it is uncoftable because I want to sit on my sofa and I am not that
athletic to sit on a sofa with a laptop,. I own a SAmsung A38 5G, I bought it a
month ago bc my old hpne (samsung a32) was not withh those OS updates and so I
wanted to be safe on the software updates, that is why I bought it. I did the
same with th other: **hide apps on the homescreen**, so I kept the basics, use
the timer (built-in-feature for Wellbeing, I know for some is a s\*\*t but I
didn't wanted to download more apps bc I will download and then uninstall and
the find a new one and so and so. So I tried to **keep it simple**. Oh, another
thing I did was to chose my phone black, I like colors and my A32 was colored
and my case was pink and it made me love it, but this time I had to take
advantage of the situation and have it less appealing, I bough it a case yes
because I'm so dub I always drop things and I don't want to broke it bc I don't
want to spend more money. All in all, I took the quote *""out of sight, out of
mind""* and make it real, beause I know that if visually speaking my phone is
appealing to me I will be glued to it.  I just want to say that everyone is
unique, we have to know ourselves first; and I know it is difficult, but if we
take that amount of time per day (could be+8 hours, 4 hours, then 2, then 1 and
half) to meditate or do anyother thing that does **not** include internet, then
we'll get to know how to hear ourselves. I have done journaling since 2020, and
while reading those pages I see I have always struggled with this social media
addiction and noticed I wanted to quit but it was helpless. Until now. I see two
years ago I had fall into scrolling many times while trying to quit, but I
always got up and tried onece again. And IDK but my ""Higher Power"" helped me,
tough.  I hope you find something useful here, just as I say to me ""*remember to
keep on going, remember no one is the same, we're all different, we learn and
came across different situations, remember to hear your inner self and be
present, and remember learn from others because* [there is always going to be a
person better of worse than you](https://allpoetry.com/desiderata---words-for-

ehrmann)).  Cheers, and go out, sut down your phone for a while and just **one
day a at time**     Oh, I forgot to mention that I have *read only* posts here
on Reddit to inform me, to see if I get help on phone addiction etc, but this
time I created this account to share my experience and add it to this community.

"For Me, The Issue is Social Media","For Me, The Issue is Social Media

I started leaving my phone in the car last week and used rules on my router to
block social media.  Ot turns out these tiny screens aren’t as addictive when
you’re reading reviews on IMDB, articles on Apple News, or looking up facts. I
switched to a timer lock box that doesn’t open until I’m about to start work and
it’s so helpful    I  seem to move around a lot more, all my laundry and dishes
are done.  I’m normally a clean, organized person but this is next level. I have
a lot less anxiety in the morning and time is slower and I feel way more
present.

 Social media force feeds you content, its not that it's super addictive it just
gives you media you never asked to see. I realized I don't even enjoy the
content I'm seeing It's just in front of me. I ended up uninstalling tiktok and
twitter because I was seeing more content that I didnt subscribe to than I did
content that I did subscribe to.

cut my screen time from 6+ hrs to like 1. feels weird.,"cut my screen time from 6+ hrs to like 1. feels weird.

so i was wasting way too much time scrolling this year. like... 4 hours on
socials (reddit included) and another 2 on texts and other pointless junk. 6+
hours. just... gone.  tried to cut back and it was annoying, but it's honestly
wild how different things feel. life is slower. in a good way, not a boring way.
i actually have time for other things now. reading, exercise, just... sitting
back watching birds.  main thing i learned is how easy it is to fall back into
it. and that being bored is actually... fine? your brain kinda panics for a bit
when you have nothing to do, but then it just gets calm. it's nice.  what
actually worked:  * i just kept a book next to my phone. so when i instinctively
grabbed the phone, i'd just grab the book instead. * had to get a serious app
blocker. the default ios one is useless, you just tap ""ignore"" lol.  i actually
found this app called hardest focus app. it blocks your entire phone during your
focus sessions, and if you try to check it, it blasts a loud siren and proceeds
to delete progress in 5 seconds if i don't put it back. not gonna lie, it's
kinda jarring and makes you panic a little, but that's the point, it immediately
keeps you away from phone. there are other app blockers like freedom, but this
one really makes you feel the consequence of breaking focus.  now i kinda crave
the time away from my phone, which is new. gonna try and keep it under an hour
for the next month.  idk. anyone else tried this? what stuff did you do that
wasn't a huge pain?

 I feel like this app was advertised here before with exactly the same
description. 
 


 Yeah, that initial boredom is just withdrawal. Your brain’s used to constant
novelty, and when it stops getting it, it panics a bit. But what comes after
that is clarity, the kind that only shows up when the noise is gone. Keep
leaning into that silence; that’s where focus and creativity start to rebuild. 
 


 I leave my charger in another room 
 


 often when I take the book I end up falling asleep   Good work bro

What I learned while reducing phone screen time by 80% — 6 hrs per day to 1hr,"What I learned while reducing phone screen time by 80% — 6 hrs per day to 1hr

One of my goals when this year started was to reduce scrolling and find more
productive things to fill that time. I was spending 4+ hours on social media
(including Reddit) and 2+ hours on messaging and work stuff. Cutting this down
has been hard, but life changing.  I feel like my life has slowed down (in a
good way) and I have time for all the things I’ve been wanting to do (read,
meditate, exercise).  My biggest takeaways are:  * There is more time in the day
than you realize * It's extremely easy to ""slip"", as I have many times in the
past * Being ""productive"" doesn't always mean reaching for your phone just for
the sake of doing something — sometimes doing nothing can set you up for more
long term productivity * We are meant to be bored sometimes (and being bored can
make you enjoy the little things more)  The biggest things that helped were:  *
Creating 30 day plan, each week my goal was to cut back one hour (ended up doing
more) * Asking “is this the best usage of mental energy right now?” each time I
reach for my phone (I reminded myself to ask this question with a rubber band
over my phone) * Having a go to ""redirect"", I keep a book next to my phone so I
can pick that up instead * Using an app blocker with stricter settings than iOS
screen time (iOS defaults are too easy to skip)    * Set up ""morning"" and
""evening"" downtime to block distracting apps 5-9a, and 6-midnight    * Set up
specific daily limits or # of opens on each individual distracting app * Embrace
the boredom, our minds tend to panic when we don't have ""something to do"", but
if you can push through the initial panic, there is a real sense of calm on the
other side  Now I find myself craving more phone free-time, it's like I've
tasted freedom and my mind wants more. I am going to experiment with longer and
longer phone-free breaks. My next goal is to stay under 1 hour and see what all
that unlocks over the next month...

 Once I realized all of these notifications and apps were just fancy fidget
spinners, and I was designing my own hamster wheel, my interest in smartphones
greatly decreased. 
 
     That's a great insight. It feels like waking up to a new world when you realize that after using these
    apps for years, at least that's how it felt for me...

     You can turn off all notifications except call… that’s what I have.  My email/texts gets checked when I
    check it.

     you've successfully influenced me to turn off all notifications except calls/texts! i never saw it as
    ""hamster on a wheel on my own making"" before, thank you.

     Damn. Word



 Great advice, thanks for sharing! Another tip I find helps is to keep a small
notebook to hand. I found myself reaching for my phone all the time to check
something or look something up. Write down any questions or things to look up
online in the notepad, then spend a short allocated time at some point in the
day to look them all up in one hit, rather than constantly reaching for the
phone. 
 
     This is great! I do this and it helps A LOT. I even mentioned this strategy in an interview and they
    thought it was an amazing idea. (I got that job too lol)

     Love this tip. That's a great idea, I'll have to add to the list and try this out. Thanks for sharing!

     This is a useful one, indeed. The only thing is, I found it hard to sustain this habit. Of course, not
    given up yet.

     If you practice pomodoro, you can use your 5 minute break to look things up

     This is brilliant. Thanks.

     I started using a pocket notebook like this, but I also used it as a sort of dumbed-down bullet journal. I
    even put it in the pocket I used to put my phone in. Having something else to turn to to read, peruse, or
    jot thoughts down in was a great way to further decrease my dependancy on my phone.

     This is a great idea

     Great advice bro.

     Thanks OP!  I just downloaded and subscribed to Roots.

     Is this the app you used to set screen time limits? is it free? Thank you



 Thank you buddy i am also gonna cut it down because mine problem is also same as
u!! 
 
     You’re welcome. Good luck! It’s so worth it to cut it down



 Grayscale mode is great to reduce screen time as well 
 
     Yes! I recently switched my phone over to grayscale and it’s so much less interesting and addictive.



 Nice work! Keep it up! Which app blocker do u use? 
 
     [removed]

     I used ScreenZen and it has helped me a lot. It’s completely free and you can customize it however you
    want. I



 Thanks for sharing. I pay for a screen time limiter and I’m still averaging like
7 hours a day. Had enough 
 
     Oh dang... yeah I actually tried several and it can be hit or miss, some are too easy to skip like the
    apple and android defaults are  maybe the rubber band trick will work better for you. Good luck!



 i wanted to do this, but i dont know what to do when im not on my phone. what do
you do, op aside from reading books? 
 
     I’m not OP, but I took up crocheting when I was deliberately trying to cut down on screen time. I listen
    to podcasts or audiobooks while I do it, so I keep my brain and my hands engaged. If crafts are not your
    thing, maybe puzzles would work in the same way.  For the “I’m bored right now” short, impulsive phone
    grabs, I’m recognizing that it really is more a sign of my brain needing a minute to chill than that I’m
    interested in my phone. I’ve tried to replace that with either sitting outside for a few minutes and being
    really cognizant of sensations (like sun on my face, wind, the falling temperature, the smell of autumn),
    or with a quick, low-stakes chore (putting one misplaced item away, fluffing the couch cushions,
    straightening a table, throwing out yesterday’s junk mail).



 I love this, and I really want to try it! Question: Do you consider using your
phone to listen to music as screen time? I'm just curious because I listen to
music in the background for the majority of my day, and it keeps me tethered to
my phone, unfortunately. 
 
     This was my biggest beef about iPods becoming phones. And battery life. Idk why we had to join the two!

     Good question! For me, I would not count listening to music as screen time (my phone is set to turn off
    the display when listening to music so it doesn't register as screen time, but most of the apps I've used
    allow you to exclude apps like music or baby monitors or things that shouldn't count)

     This is a great question. I would love to try this, even just limiting myself to what I would consider my
    distracting apps.  I also listen to music at work almost all day. And I use notes in my phone for a myriad
    of things: my to-do list, grocery list, calendar (which I check every morning and night).  Unfortunately,
    my job has me texting coworkers, taking calls, and checking my email often. Im also a student and we have
    a group chat for notes and classwork. I don’t necessarily consider those to be unproductive screen time
    though.   Maybe setting that barrier for yourself, what do you consider to be unproductive screen time?
    For me it would be Instagram, Reddit, Facebook…

"What do people with less screen time, say 2 or 3 hours a day, usually do with the rest of their time?","What do people with less screen time, say 2 or 3 hours a day, usually do with the rest of their time?

I've been trying to cut down my screen time lately — especially time spent on my
phone. While I know some people manage to keep their daily screen time really
low (like 2–3 hours total), I’m genuinely curious:  What do you spend the rest
of your day doing?

 something you love will take your time. I usually start with one chapter of a
book.   But not all of us are booklovers. You just need to find something you
really like 
 
     I don't have any proper prolonged hobbies. Im also not good at any sports even though I love a few sports.
    I have some reasons to not start with most hobbies I like. All these years I spent just doom scrolling and
    playing some mobile games. I didnt pick up any sport or craft. I don't know what else to do if I stop doom
    scrolling. I'm not a book lover as well ;(

     True, once you find that one thing you genuinely enjoy, it’s way easier to forget about your phone for
    hours.

     This is a beautiful quote

     This is most important.   Find something your mind would rather be doing and you'll find scrolling your
    phone meaningless and booring.



 I have been doing more audio books. throwing in my earbuds I can do household
tasks or even just sit and listen. It’s been nice. I will watch tv maybe the
last hour of the day. 
 
     Nice, I will give it a try.



 Hobbies, socialization, starting/working on businesses (this can in include
screens but it’s productive!), napping, reading, there’s a lot you can do tbh.
When theres no device your brain will come up with things to do and that’s the
best part. You decide to do new things you never tried before. 
 
     What's your screen time? Just curious

     Do you remember how long you used to run as a beginner? I'm living in a slightly hilly region—would it be
    a good idea to start running as a hobby?  Some days, when I feel sluggish after spending hours on my
    phone, I take a 20-minute walk to get some fresh air. So, I’m thinking of starting walking as a daily
    evening routine and making it a hobby.  After doing that consistently for a few days, weeks, or even
    months, I’d like to start running. So, how long did you run as a beginner?



 I read books on my Kindle and it's improved my life so much to do so. 
 
     Any tips on reading a book? I usually can't read for long periods.



 Take walks,  Exercise,  Listen to music/podcasts (yes, I use my phone, but this
is good screen time imo),  Cook  Use an app and website blocker (I use Stayfree)
and see what happens 
 
     I don't want to take the fun away from anyone when it comes to podcast or music, I love listening to
    podcasts myself. But I can also really recommend complete silence sometimes, and just letting your
    thoughts run. Listening to media is still consuming information, and IMO quite similar to using the phone
    directly, as you still keep the information noise going all the time. Walks I always do without any
    headphones. It's so nice to be able to hear the nature, the birds singing, people talking. The sound is
    part of the experience, and it can be very relaxing. For other situations, the mental noise might actually
    be welcome, eg when cleaning, cooking or driving. In those situations I really enjoy my podcasts. 



 Seeing friends, going for a walk, taking care of the garden, going to the public
pool, talking to my neighbors, babysitting, reading, cooking, gaming, arts and
crafts... I recently reduced my screentime and I have sooooo much time and
energy for hobbies!!! 
 
     So you just keep yourselves occupied throughout the day by indulging in different activities as listed
    here? But somedays you might not feel the energy to do these activities, what do you do then?



 Watercolor or other painting, drawing, other art, crochet, swimming, volunteer,
thrifting for things to redo for my house, redo those things,
meditation/mindfulness, reading, games, on a rare occasion sewing, visit
friends, go for walks, go to museums.   In the past I did more cooking, hiking,
attend exeecise classes 
 
     Does your place have many museums nearby, or do you usually travel to the nearest one, even if it's around
    one or two hours away?



 When I make an effort to not use my phone, it's nuts. I start just coming up
with random things to do.  Cleaning up rooms or areas I put off. Places junk
piles up. I might go start cleaning up and reorganizing the garage. I enjoy
detailing my cars... like giving it more life or doing maintenance. Lift
weights. Actually spend a bit of time cooking a good meal instead of something
unhealthy. Walks outside - usually in the evenings now with it being so hot.
Sometimes I even just go for drives for fun. 
 


 I read books on my Kindle and it's improved my life so much to do so.

Last night I checked my iPhone screen time history report of the year. It
claimed that in 2025, I had already spent more than 1,000 hours on my phone.
That is ten percent of the whole year... gazing at a rectangle.      The crazy
part? I do not even recall what it was most of that time I was staring at. I did
not get to know 1,000 hours of new skills or spend 1,000 hours in meaningful
conversations. It was just… scrolling.      Any other person get sick when you
see how much of your life gets gobbled by a screen?

 10%? That's 2.5 hours a day??   Rookie 
 
     [removed]

     You have 25h in a day?



 Don’t beat yourself up. Even though you can’t remember those 1000 hours, a lot
of it could be listening to music, looking up recipes or restaurants, or pulling
up directions.   If you’re concerned, try learning a new skill and make that
your daily pick-up instead - like Duolingo or Chess. As long as you’re not
mindlessly scrolling, whatever you’re doing is probably improving your life in
one way or another. 
 
     Use a screen blocker like steptime, helps reduce screen time by converting steps for screen time



 How do you get a yearly report? 
 
     I have the same question

     Same



 Oh big time, I display my screentime on my phone 24/7 as a little popup over
everything, it DISGUSTS me how quickly you can rack up time. If I wake up at 6,
sometimes I'll have a total screen time of 1.5 hours by 8😭 I made an app that
does this, it does help being aware of it 24/7 icl, linked in my bio if
interested or ""screentime overlay"" on Google play 
 
     Is it available for ios?

     Do you feel like seeing it at all times makes you use your phone less?



 I’ve been averaging 8-9 hours a day on my phone. It’s an addiction fr 
 
     14 hrs here



 Who cares. Just do your best to find productive hobbies and try to find
moderation with some that aren’t so healthy. What did we do before we had
phones, stare at the wall, tv, words in a book, or play in the dirt?
Productivity is subjective. 
 


 Just remember that people wasted time looking at nothing before phones, so don’t
feel too bad! 
 
     Looking at nothing is probably better for your health though.

     Looking at TV



 Whatcha wanna do instead? I study strategic control of attention and I’m
learning that if you start to feel tense about being on your phone, you might
switch to something else assuming you have another option!  Edit: FOR SCIENCE 
 


 You’re definitely not alone. That stat hits hard when you see it in black and
white. I had a similar wake-up call when I looked at my yearly report and
realized I’d basically given weeks of my life to endless scrolling. What helped
me was setting app limits and replacing one scroll session a day with something
purposeful, like reading, walking, or journaling. Even small changes add up, and
it feels good to reclaim some of that time.

how 30 minutes of morning phone scrolling was ruining my entire life,"how 30 minutes of morning phone scrolling was ruining my entire life

I used to wake up and immediately grab my phone. just 30 minutes of scrolling,
what's the harm right? wrong. i felt like absolute shit every single morning and
had zero motivation for anything. the phone was just there on my nightstand, too
easy to click and scroll and get that instant dopamine hit before even getting
out of bed.  one day i had enough. i was sick of feeling like garbage before my
day even started. promised myself i wouldn't look at my phone in the morning for
the next 3 days. managed to do it for 3 days. then it became 7. then 14. now
it's been over a year.  the change is insane. i started running every morning,
reading every single day, and i genuinely feel so much better. one interesting
thing I realised is that when i don't use my phone in the morning, i use it way
less throughout the entire day. idk what the psychology behind this is but it
works.  few years ago my screen time was 8-10 hours daily. watching stuff on the
bus, in taxis, even in elevators for those 30 seconds. now it's around 2-3 hours
and most of that is calling my family since i don't live with them anymore, plus
some messages here and there.  that first 30 minutes sets the tone for
everything. if anyone else is struggling with this, just try 3 days. seriously.

 I just wake up and I am on my phone for almost 30 minutes and I was already
feeling like crap… this post came just in time I’m gonna try this starting
tomorrow for sure 
 
     Good morning, we can break this cycle today. Let’s be more mindful starting from now. That goes for both
    you and me.

     I started trying this a couple of weeks ago. Really trying to cut down on screen time in general but
    especially in the morning after waking up. The different I felt was immediate and pretty wild. I felt
    calmer, more focused and my brain wasn’t overwhelmed with a million thoughts. Such a hard habit to break
    but it really did make me feel a lot better.

     I wake up every morning and get on my phone while I take a crap.

     I'm watching you 👀

     Leave your phone in the car or something so it’s not anywhere for you to get sucked into. I have a 10x
    better morning when I do this.

     I’m going to start tomorrow morning and take it one day at a time. I’d rather have time to sit and enjoy
    my breakfast instead of rushing out the door because I spent half an hour doomscrolling instead of getting
    ready for work.

     Check out a device called Brick. My wife and I started using one over the last month. We set it to block
    our phones when we go to bed and it won’t unblock our phones until we physically tap it. It’s kept on our
    refrigerator so we have to get out of bed to “unbrick” them.

     Me too!

     Saaaaaaame

     Exactly my sentiments!

     I’m in too!

     me too, think i’ll start it as well

     Ditto here too!

     Count me in!



 so true, our phones are stealling our time, which is the best resource that we
have 
 
     The most valuable resource.

     great quote I saw recently, attention is the currency of future

     And we don't even realise it



 💯  after lots of experiments of different techniques, including uninstalling
social apps (just keeping a shortcut link to lunch IG, FB, TT, etc, in browser),
i found i think the ultimate hack- start your day journaling about your plans
for the day in the morning, and at the evening reflect on what you achieved.
also made a small tool for myself to facilitate that. changed my life. 
 
     Happy for you! Can you share the tool with us too

     share with us please

     share the tool too

     What’s the tool?!

     What’s the tool?

     Dude, this is exactly what I needed to read. I was stuck in the same cycle - waking up and immediately
    grabbing my phone to scroll for like 30+ minutes. Felt like garbage every morning.  Your comment about
    morning planning + evening reflection actually inspired me to build something similar. Been using it for a
    few weeks now and honestly... it's a game changer. There's something about getting your thoughts out first
    thing that just sets the whole day differently.  I ended up making it into a little app (called FirstHour)
    because I'm a developer and got tired of using random note apps that weren't designed for this workflow.
    Nothing fancy - just morning planning with a simple todo list, then evening check-in to see how it went.
    The crazy part is I barely touch social media in the mornings anymore. Like you said with the browser
    shortcuts - once you break that automatic phone grab habit, everything changes.  Would love to know more
    about your tool - always curious how other people tackle this. And if anyone wants to try mine, happy to
    share (it's free, just genuinely think this approach works).  Search it up on the iOS app store. Its
    called ""The First Hour""  Thanks for posting this - needed the reminder that I'm not the only one who
    figured out morning routines are everything.



 I stopped first thing in the morning scrolling a while ago.  It is absolutely
true that it makes a huge difference in the rest of your day. The way I explain
it to my kids is that if you start your day with ""the dopamine machine,"" there
is nothing in normal life that can compete. Everything just seems so boring. 
 
     Bro cruising around on a kayak with an electric motor sounds way more fun than a phone, I don’t get what
    you’re saying lol



 Yes! I once read that if you look at your phone first thing in the morning, and
are getting that dopamine hit, your brain seeks out that same dopamine hit for
the rest of the day. Which is why when you don’t look at your phone first thing
in the morning your screen time is usually better throughout the day. I do keep
my phone on my nightstand but I’ve stopped scrolling first thing in the morning
and have replaced it with doing the Wordle, connections, and other quick New
York Times games. I’m usually pretty good about staying off social media for the
first hour im awake and it does make a huge difference! 
 


 Good job! just to be clear this isn't exclusively a phone thing, it's more about
having the willpower to start your day with the less rewarding difficult tasks,
when your dopanime levels are highest and cortisol lowest. In my case I was
never a phone addict, but I'd spend hours watching series on the computer, or
reading fiction, when I should be working and studying instead.  The leap to a
different routine is the hardest thing we can do, as animals of habit. 
 
     This is what i do. I keep scrolling pinterest, watching anime or tv shows or YouTube instead of studying
    Can't seem to stop.. if I don't use my phone i use my tablet.. I'm going crazy.. i have so much to study i
    just can't seem to do so..



 Good stuff. I plan to start leaving my Phone int he living room from now on.
Thanks for inspiring!!! 
 
     good luck :)



 Putting my phone down now after 45 minutes and seeing this post! Thank you!!!!! 
 


 Set a simple rule: no phone until after one tiny anchor, like a glass of water
and 2 minutes of movement or one page of reading. Make it hard to break by
charging the phone outside the bedroom and scheduling Do Not Disturb to lift
after that anchor. What would your pre-phone anchor be for the next 3 mornings?

How do you reduce screen time?,"How do you reduce screen time?

What actually helped you reduce your smartphone addiction and regain control of
your screen time? Any specific apps, strategies, or mindset shifts that made a
real difference?

 Recently someone mentioned Screenzen on this subreddit.  I installed it,
selected the apps i want to reduce usage on (reddit and instagram for me)
selected that i wanted to wait 30 seconds before i could open said apps, i can
scroll for 10 minutes and unlock it 3x per day.  Honestly, does wonders.  It
annoys the hell out of me that i have it and i love it. I barely get to the 3
opens a day nor do i want to look at my screen seeing the counter go down from
30 to 0.  Go grab it, its free and does wonders. 
 
     ScreenZen also worked for me! And it also has a feature to lock the ScreenZen app settings and prevent
    uninstalling, so you genuinely can't override the time limits you set when you get annoyed by them

     Omg thank you so much

     I was hoping for an app like that... Thank you so much...

     I can’t find the Reddit app to block though 🤣

     Just downloaded, thanks for the tip!

     im so addicted that i keep blocking screenzen asw

     wow, Thanks for the info



 Switch to greyscale. The screen is nowhere near as appealing. 
 
     Yes, this! 100%. I have been doing this for years, super helpful.



 My therapist made a great point about this recently and it helped me a lot. I'm
constantly multitasking, my focus is always split and I'm easily distracted. My
phone is a big part of that problem. So now I try to intentionally single task
on specific tasks for a set amount of time. It has completely changed the way I
use my phone during the week. 
 


 Having hobbies, I have all social media apps on my phone yet I rarely open them,
once or twice a month at most (with the exception of Reddit 😅)   I when I’m not
working I go snowboarding, rock climbing or to the climbing gym, meet up with
friends, read a book, I don’t have time for social media & my interest with it
decreased over the years just but using my free time to actually do things I
enjoy 
 
     Congratulations you have life which 95% active users dont have and cry abt it why they dont have it so
    live it happily

     Yes, this is the most effective strategy hands down. When I was meeting regularly with my Meetup group
    before the last implosion, lol, I would rarely spend time on Reddit or TikTok or other social media. I
    would watch YouTube when others were busy at work because my schedule varies each day, but when meeting up
    with friends to hike, play board games, get dinner, watch a movie, explore an international market, engage
    in conversation with people outside of work, and so on, I wouldn't be on my phone as much.   The only
    exception was when we were playing Dungeons and Dragons, and if I wasn't the Dungeon Master, I would just
    be on my phone reading news articles or playing with AI because I would get horrible dice rolls during my
    turn and not be able to do much. Ditto when we played Sid Meyer's Civilizations and Crusader Kings 3. I
    hate turn-based games where I am stuck for multiple rounds based on luck and loading mechanics. 🤣



 What helped me was a making your phone screen less appealing. I used greyscale +
app limit+ keeping the app screen to one screen only with the essential apps. I
am referring to iOS just one screen for only the essential or boring apps. I’m
sure android or other platform will have similar options. 
 


 I have magazines and crossword/sudoku/ word game books around the house. It
gives me something g else to do/ look at in those in-between moments. So it
stops me from starting a scroll. I spend maybe an hour or two a week less on my
phone as a result.   I also made a big effort to do less screen time before bed.
I’m not fully there but it’s getting better. So I guess maybe setting specific
goals about reducing screen time might help? 
 


 Go back to pen and paper.  Delete everything on your phone except essentials for
texting , calling and paying bills. Everything else is junk.   Now your phones
only used for business and personal calls. Don’t use your phone when you first
wake up and don’t use it before going to bed. Do anything else like read, relax,
cook, stretch, journal, work out or be with a loved one.   Enjoy your new life
not on your phone all the time. 
 
     Do you use reddit on a computer?



 Make a conscious effort to work on another activity. It can be watching a movie,
cleaning the house, reading a book, engaging in a craft or art project… But put
the phone away. Like put it in your sock drawer in your bedroom away. Set it to
mute, get it out of sight and that will help you keep it out of mind. 
 


 Minimalist phone app 
 


 I use an app called ""Digital Detox"". So basically it's a screen control app
which you can use whenever you want to stay away from your phone. You first set
the hours and set the apps which you need to allow like ""Phone"" and such and
then you start the timing. If you decide to quit midway, it asks to pay as a
penalty, which is a great incentive. There is a way where you can access your
phone for 2 mins (x3) in case of emergency. You can also run it on a schedule.
Do check it out. It's a good app.

Does anyone else feel like apps that limit screen time simply don’t work?,"Does anyone else feel like apps that limit screen time simply don’t work?

For instance, let’s imagine you set a time limit for Instagram of 1 hour a day.
It’s cool that the app blocks Instagram after you go past that time limit, but
this is a symbolic block, since you can always go to the app and change the
settings so that you can use Instagram more time than the limit you initially
set.  Do these apps work for you? I feel that they don’t really solve the
problem of wasting my time on my phone, thus reducing my productive time of the
day.

 I wish there was an app that would give you notices instead of blocking.
Sometimes I am doing something important and other times I need to be awakened
from a deep scroll coma. AppBlock doesn't help this much. 
 
     I wish there was an app that gives me a smack on the head

     Not quite what you're asking for, but there is an app called ""one sec"" that makes you take a deep breath
    before opening an app (like Instagram) so it makes you be intentional about opening it... Kinda like what
    you're saying about, sometimes it's fine to be on apps and other times you know it's just pointless
    scrolling

     Minimalist phone has a timer for apps you select. So you can say you want to browse Reddit for say 10
    minutes and it will remind you after 10 min. You can always set new reminders afterwards.

     Present does!

     Yeah, my issue is my computer, but I'd love an app that would just but a gaint number in the bottom corner
    of the screen of how many minutes i had spent on that site. Particuarly good if I can only enable it on
    certain websites, awareness is half the battle.  I've just sat down when i've come home from work, just
    wanted to browse reddit quickly and then get to doing everything I wanted and 30 minutes has already past,
    I was meaning to just have a quick 5 minute look.

     What if there was an app that charged us for every additional minute we use our phone or social media. For
    example if you go 15 minutes past the limit you initially set, you’d have to pay 15 cents. Do you think
    that would work for you, honestly I think that’s the only way to keep myself off the phone.

     Try ScreenZen

     Try OneSec

     With the default Android wellbeing App you get a notification if you have left for example 5 minutes of
    your remaining time.   What I also did is placing a widget with your app time on one screen. So i swipe to
    this screen and see how much time I already spent on the phone on this day.

     Apple have options for limits for apps. If you reach the alloyed time, it’ll send a notification and ask
    if you want more time.

     I have to start AppBlock as soon as I wake up or else I end up in scroll comas for the entire day 🫠

     StayFree can do this I think.

     [removed]

     In the pro version of one sec, you can set a time limit (say 3 minutes) and it will re-start the breathing
    exercise after 3 minutes were passed on the app



 In college I had a buddy who was having a really hard time with screen time , we
came to a solution, he set shis app limits in system settings and password
locked them, I set the password. We were roommates and it worked pretty well in
that he never blocked so many apps that it killed all functionality and if he
desperately needed it we had an agreement that I would relinquish the password
but it would immediately change once he was done with his emergency. We pulled
that off for like a solid semester or 2 and by the end of it he didn't really
need it anymore. Good luck 
 
     This!   OP should try this out if he/she has any friends



 [deleted] 
 
     Same here brother. What if there was an app that charged us for every additional minute we use our phone
    or social media. For example if you go 15 minutes past the limit you initially set, you’d have to pay 15
    cents. Would you use such an app? Honestly I think that’s the only way to keep myself off the phone.



 I've had my computer set up for years to block reddit in the DNS `hosts` file
when I shouldn't be on it.  Issue is though, that as a programmer... a lot of
troubleshooting searches I do turn out to go to reddit threads.  So I have to
disable the blocking many times a day.  And then it's easy to just keep fucking
around on reddit from there.  And there's also the random temptations to
unnecessarily disable the blocking too.  One area it does help though:  There's
also the issue of where I had zero conscious thought/plan of going to reddit,
but my body is just on autopilot, and without even being aware that I'm doing
it... I just automatically open chrome, and type `re<enter>` and I'm now on
reddit without even ""knowing"".  So at least the blocking helps with that.  I
have many moments where this happens, and chrome show me an error... and I'm
like... fuck... I didn't even know I just did that. 
 
     This is my problem too, Reddit is one of my biggest time sinks, but also not completely useless, so
    blocking it can cause issues.  I did use an app that allowed you to take a break for a few minutes, I set
    that up with the intention that those few minutes would allow me to quickly read what I wanted, but I soon
    defaulted just to using that for mindless surfing and then using up the whole allowence without meaning
    too, leaving me stuck when I really needed it.

     What if there was an app that charged us for every additional minute we use our phone or social media. For
    example if you go 15 minutes past the limit you initially set, you’d have to pay 15 cents. Do you think
    that would work for you?  I’ve been thinking about it and I feel that would work to keep myself off the
    phone.



 Time blockers are just a tool. They don't work if your brain say has adhd and
would rather do anything else then that one thing. But, it is a good tool. And
hey, if you didn't do the thing, but watched a movie rather then youtube, that's
a win in my book.  &#x200B;  There is software that will block things computer
wide according to your settings. I think FocusMe was very good, and so is Cold
Turkey. In fact i know plenty of software that will block you from going into
settings and uninstall it. LockMeOut was another good one i think.  &#x200B;
I've also heard that you need to have something to replace that thing with. Are
you on InstaBookTokItter because it gives you something to do that is a step
above boredom, sitting with your own feelings, our own life? Is it because it
gives you a sense of social inclusion? The internet is not real life. Figure out
why you're spending so much time on it when from being here, you DON'T want to
be. Find other things. And if you can't figure out why. I think - like a
comedian said once - that in 100 years they'll think it was crazy we just used
the internet all the time. It's addictive like a drug i think. It no doubt
rewires the brain and we won't see how for a generation of two. FYI, Dear god
keep your kids off it and video games for as long a possible. So if you can't
quit it, maybe you need to treat it like an addiction - along with getting some
therapy to rule out any other issues.  Now, time to go productively
procrastinate in other subreddits fully aware of the irony 🦸 
 
     I agree with you man, we should treat it like an addiction. What if there was an app that charged us for
    every additional minute we use our phone or social media. For example if you go 15 minutes past the limit
    you initially set, you’d have to pay 15 cents. Do you think that would work for you?  I’ve been thinking
    about it and I feel that would work to keep myself off the phone.

     There is no mobile version of FocusMe 😭😭😭 Or else I would use it and there wouldn't be any problem



 It’s actually harmful when used like that cause you lose integrity with yourself
when you just change the settings.   Why do you think you change the settings? 
 
     True.  Just like a friend of mine tried to block adult sites, but ""allow this site"" again and again.  It's
    the mindset that needs to change, cannot do it that way.  Screentime can only use for alerting oneself,
    but not limiting.

     Because u can, sometimes u r in a situation when u want to use the phone, and changing setting is easy to
    escape again to phone



 [removed] 
 
     Hahaha same here I always end up changing the settings. But what if there was an app that charged us for

    good solution for me, if money was coming out of my pocket I’d definitely get off the phone.



 After a day or two I stopped using screen time like that. I keep all social
media apps deleted from the phone and have to actively install them if I want to
check something. Then I delete it when I'm done.  Also, I apply 'content and
privacy restrictions' and block pretty much everything so I can't access things
through Safari. I add a passcode too. Yes, I can override it but it creates
multiple steps and reminders which usually make me stop the unconscious
scrolling/checking. 
 


 Whenever I get the Instagram alert that I’ve been on for 30 mins I almost get
happy because it means I can do something else. Doesn’t work so well for other
apps in my experience. 
 


 I had set 20 min times each on reddit and twitter in iphone focus time ,
password is set by my daughter, so once it is over, it is over for good, i Dont
ask her to unlock the app unless really required for business pages

From 8 hours to 30 minutes - how I finally broke my phone addiction,"From 8 hours to 30 minutes - how I finally broke my phone addiction

I'm honestly ashamed to write this… but my screen time was averaging 8 hours a
day (mostly social media videos)… it was completely destroying my focus and
relationships.  The scary part is how it just sneaks up on you…  **Morning:**
scroll in bed (1.5+ hrs)   **Coffee/meals:** always with my phone (45+ mins)
**After work:** ""quick check"" that turns into hours (2.5 hrs)   **Before bed:**
""just 10 minutes"" becomes 2+ hours   **Middle of the night:** when I can't
sleep, more scrolling (1+ hr)   **Random throughout the day:** (1.5 hrs)  I
finally hit my breaking point when I realized I'd spent an entire Saturday just…
scrolling. Like literally the whole day was gone.  So I went nuclear and tried a
bunch of strategies I found here on reddit...  **1) Phone goes to grayscale
after 6pm**   I absolutely hate how it looks… which is exactly the point.
Everything becomes so much less appealing when it's not designed to hijack your
brain with colors and notifications.  **2) Complete social media blackout from
9pm to 9am**   Those late night and early morning sessions were the worst for my
mental health. I felt like garbage every single time. Now I can still watch
Netflix at night, but at least I'm actually watching instead of splitting my
attention.  **3) Earned screen time blockers (this one's brutal but works)**
Yeah, screen time blockers. Everyone talks about them because they actually
work. Doesn't matter which app you use. I set mine to block everything and you
have to earn screen time throughout the day. I made it ridiculously hard on
myself... 30 minute workout only gets me 5 minutes of screen time. It sounds
extreme but it completely flipped my relationship with my phone.  **4) Actually
replace the habit with stuff I enjoy**   This was huge. You can't just remove
something without filling the void.  I had a stack of books I bought months ago
just sitting there, so now I keep one with me for those random 5-minute gaps.
My keyboard was literally gathering dust in the corner. Now I mess around with
it for 20-30 minutes most days and it's honestly more satisfying than any video
I've ever watched.  I've been texting old friends I'd been meaning to reach out
to but never did because I was too busy being ""busy"" on my phone.  And I'm
actually learning Spanish (slowly) instead of just saving ""learn Spanish"" videos
that I never watch again.  **The results are honestly wild.** I have so much
more mental energy. I'm not constantly anxious about missing something. And I'm
actually doing things I've been saying I wanted to do for years.  Still not
perfect, but going from 8 hours to 90 minutes feels like getting my life back.

 I will try the grayscale tip. 
 
     Is there an automatic way to do this on iPhone?

     Grayscale. LIFE CHANGING.  It makes me hate it, so I just go into the app I need, do what I have to do.
    And that’s it.  Problem, is that at least I haven’t figured out how to use grayscale on the apps?   Like I
    open Reddit or ig and the colours pop back on.   (iPhone 16 user).

     Grayscale didn't work for me. I would feel practically disabled on it and would try to circumnavigate that
    mode to not have problems navigating my phone. Turning up eye comfort shield on my phone to max, where
    everything is an almost monochrome red with just the slightest bit of color did work pretty well though.
    Especially when I turn it from a mode, that'll launch a popup with a convenient ""disable"" button, to a
    routine, that would trigger silently and thus requires me to dig through the settings to disable it.  The
    modes and routines thing is a Samsung thing, not sure if it exists for the rest of Android, or if there's
    something similar out there.

     Just set this up myself!

     How can you turn the phone into greyscale? I absolutely would love this



 How do you do the “earning screen time” thing? 
 
     yes, can you please suggest an app

     Not OP, but I recommend TimeCap, which gives you a couple of minutes of scrolling per hour. It also
    removes reels from instagram, shorts from youtube, and so on...

     Commenting to follow for this answer!

     Also want to know what app OP uses for this!

     I use an app called ""Achieve! Earn Your Screen Time"" on iOS. So far so good, I like it better than simply
    blocking out my distractions since I always end up finding workarounds for the other screen blockers. This
    way my ""workaround"" is something productive

     Yes please suggest an app



 This is super inspiring. That ‘quick check’ spiral is so real. Respect for
actually changing things and filling the time with stuff that brings you joy 
 
     appreciate it friend. if you're looking to make the same change I believe in you



 I’m trying to cut down my usage but just can’t seem to manage. I use my phone to
“hide” from life. My husband lost his job back in October and we are running out
of savings. Staying on my phone gives me a place to go where I can not think
about, “What are we going to do?” It’s embarrassing how long I hide in bed.  I
woke up at 7:00 today and am still in bed. Sometimes it’s easier to hide.   I’m
learning Spanish right now too! It’s tough. But fun! Congratulations on cutting
your time. 
 


 I would love to do this but I don’t think I’ve got it in me. I’m addicted 😫 
 
     Hardest part is getting started. You got this

     Does that mean that the addiction has taken away the belief in yourself that you can?

     that's what you think. I know the thought of blocking funny video apps is giving you anxiety or seems
    impossible, but just try it and give it a week. You'll see how much better life is and how much better you
    feel.

     Same!  I want to scratch that,  I NEED to.  I feel like the first week or so feels so weird.  I think it’s
    my escape from being an adult.  Throw ADD in the equation and it goes down hill fast.



 My screen time is probably even higher on my time off work, mostly because I'm a
heavy reader and I read primarily on Kindle now. If I'm awake and at home,
there's a 90% chance that I'm reading. Working 3 jobs, I'm too tired to do much
else. I don't have either the money or the space for physical books, and the
library is 20 miles away, so Kindle it is. 
 
     There's distracting screen time and productive screen time. I'd say reading sounds like a good use of time

     What type of kindle do you have? If it’s a paperwhite or similar then I’d say screen time really extra
    doesn’t matter on those devices.  I use my kindle scribe all the time but I don’t consider that screen
    time or any different than reading a physical book

     I don’t consider kindle screen time. Just another way to read a book!



 How do you set your phone to grayscale in certain hours? 
 
     on iPhone you can do it via shortcuts app. Create an automation and look for the ""Set Color Filter"" for
    the action

     i believe you have to do this manually?  updated: I found out how   iOS:  * **Shortcuts App:**    1. Open
    the Shortcuts app and tap Create Automation.     2. Select Time of Day and choose Sunset.    3. Tap Add
    Action and search for Set Color Filters.    4. Confirm Turn color filters On, and then tap Done.  *
    **Accessibility Shortcut:**    1. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size.     2. Toggle
    Color Filter On and select Grayscale.    3. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut and
    check Color Filter. 

     I’m trying to figure out how to do this but struggling

 Love this. Thank you for sharing. Taking notes thanks to your tips and feeling
reinvigorated to try reducing my screen time even more. (I'm down to an average
of 1h 36min/day at the moment)       You are spot on about the damage it does to
relationships.    Have you noticed an improvement with relationships? I
sometimes feel frustrated when I reduce my time spent on my phone and my partner
continues to be glued to his. I have no idea how to ""inspire"" or convince him to
do the same. 
 
     for myself being on the phone was a way of distracting myself from some real issues in my life...  getting
    off my phone didn't solve any of them but they gave me back the time to start addressing them and for that
    i'm grateful



 Fantastic, glad it's working for you.  I've been trying some things, too,
including one that maybe others avoid by default:  No phones in the bathroom.
I don't know what my screen time while shitting count was, but I'm betting it
was a lot more than I think.

I'm really sorry if this has already been asked here but I really can't afford
going through the posts. Do you guys have some good apps to help me reduce my
screen time. Thank you guys.

 screenzen 
 
     ScreenZen 100%  You can pay for it once if you want to help the dev. Just realizing how habitually I
    opened certain apps after using it made me take some off of my phone.   General idea:  Make a group with a
    certain amount of opens per day per app and then select what apps get that treatment  You go to open the
    app it pops up a screen that says something like, ""you've opened this app 1 of 7 times today for 5 minutes
    each"" and then you hit a button to proceed.  Then when it hits your upper number it either no longer lets
    you open it, or it does, but you lose your streak for the day. I had a few 20/7 days before I had to
    actually make it stop. And when you run out of time. It also kicks you back to the pop up screen.  It's
    the best kind of annoying imo

     Came here to support this app. It’s free and ad free.

     This app is amazing at preventing me from spending my entire day on instagram. I set it to 3 opens (10
    minutes each). I can open more than that but it would break my 200 day streak 

     Try pressing the ON & OFF button.?



 StayFree 
 
     +1 for StayFree. Also the Roots App has been fantastic. The grayscale feature is a gamechanger for me



 I use a combination that have reducere my screen time immensely (on iOS):
Minimal home screen (limits how many apps you have access to immediately) And
One Sec (makes you wait 15 seconds before entering the app of your choice)  Then
I also have  Detox  Once I enter a specific app, I have 6 minutes and then it
will be blocked for one minute (prevents mindless scrolling).  For detox I am
paying a subscription though. You should determine to yourself if the time
gained from it is worth the money   Overall, these apps I use are great for me.
I stopped mindlessly scrolling, but do still have a high screen time. My goal
was to reduce scrolling, not screen time, so for me it’s a win 
 


 Blockit on android 
 


 Opal, did wonders for me 
 


 I've been using regain for the last couple of months and I am honestly pretty
happy with it. My screen time has been reduced to around 2hr daily from 4-6. 
 
     Me too, regain has been pretty nice.



 I started using Jomo a few days ago and it’s working well for me so far. 
 
     I tried Opal and Jomo and prefer Jomo. Bonus is it's cheaper. Also use it on MacOS



 I started using Jomo this week (because doomscrolling and politics in the US
right now and my innate sense of justice make for a very unproductive day
arguing with idiots in the internet) and I really like it! In the free version I
told it which apps to ‘block’ and then when I go to open them it makes me wait
before I can and it sets a time limit (I generally choose 5-10min ‘breaks’).
Every time I open one of the apps for a break it makes me wait 10 second longer
than the last time before I can use them, and about half the time I decide to do
something else. 
 


 Roots 
 


 Forest—you plant trees. The trees die whenever you open other apps. It's
satisfying to see that you've planted a lot. There are also different trees to
choose from, so you basically decorate your forest if you're able to finish
planting them by not opening apps.

I just checked my screen time and… wow. Honestly, I almost dropped my phone. 😭
Like, I knew I was scrolling too much, but seeing it in black and white? 7 hours
yesterday. SEVEN. HOURS. Just… gone. And for what? Half of it was random
scrolling, some dumb videos, endless feeds that don’t even make me laugh
anymore.  I keep telling myself, tomorrow I’ll focus, I’ll get stuff done. But
then the cycle repeats. I feel frustrated, lazy and honestly kinda hopeless
sometimes. I want to do better, be better, actually finish things instead of
just mindlessly scrolling while my brain screams at me.  Does anyone else just…
stare at the number and think, How did I even let this happen? I need tips,
hacks, literally anything that makes me stop wasting my own time before it
becomes my whole life.

 Honestly, setting timers helped me a bit. Phone says 20 min, I try to stick to
it… sometimes works, sometimes not 😅 
 
     This is a good idea. Maybe set timers so you aren't going cold turkey on it, but also reminding yourself
    it's time to put the phone down. I've been seeing a lot of posts about how frustrated people are with
    their screen time, but unless you are giving up your phone completely, there's no need to delete
    everything and never look at another app again. Just be more mindful about managing it.

     Like, a timer? Not an app blocker? My allowed time always ends while im in the middle of an interesting
    tweet/video, so I'm glad the iPhone has an option like ""1 more minute"", because if it was an ordinary
    timer, I'd instantly forget about it after turning it off and getting back to reading/watching ""this one
    last thing""…



 There’s limits you can put from the screen time utility. Didn’t work too much
for me.   I’ve tried various apps that are limiters. Idk also didn’t work.
Best thing that worked? Got busy doing other stuff. Just literally committed to
a job & other things.   I just checked my screen time usage. It’s sitting at
2.5-3.5 hours a day since taking the job. Impressive I still have that much time
for it honestly. 
 


 You’re addicted to constant dopamine. Take a cold shower instead 
 
     This is it with this next generation. Parents putting phones in their kids faces before they can talk or
    walk. Now their feeds are so tailored they literally can get high off of visual and audio content. We
    alllllll neeeeeed to be better parents and leaders and role models. Things are going to shit.



 When I went to rehab for alcohol they don’t let you keep your phone on you for a
reason. Phones cause anxiety comparing everyday life to everyone elses highlight
reel and make our dopamine drip with our perfectly curated feeds and XXX content
too available.   But first steps require actually leave it inside for once.
Venture out without it or force yourself to leave it in ultra power save mode as
a PHONE for emergencies only is more practical. First steps always the smallest.
But mylanta man thats a third of an entire day just up in smoke.  Was weird at
first in rehab but that was 4 years ago. The more I ignore the smartphone
capabilities honestly the more refreshed I always feel mentally. I was in there
for 4 weeks and it took that long to grow accustomed to life without it. We got
our phones twice a week for 4 hours. And its one of the best things thats
happened. Forgot that freedom of not being able to be interrupted by phones
while being outside/activities/reading/wood working falling in tune with the
world and its natural beauty. Finding passion in art and sculpting and taking
deeper breaths than I have in my whole life. Had a phone at 16 and spent 20
years obsessed with it.  Dont feel frustrated take your shoes and socks off and
go outside right now and do something different today! 
 


 Get a hobby, or workout with dumbells, or walk outside listening to music :) 
 


 14 hours ( so ashamed) 
 


 I downloaded an app called ""Focus Friend,"" and you can set a deep focus timer
where you agree to not get on certain apps for a time. It is literally a little
bean that you ne and it knits socks and scarves. If you get on your phone, you
have to tap a button that stops it from making them, and it drops all its
stitches and gets sad. If you succeed, you get a bunch of socks and scarves and
can decorate your little house by selling socks for furniture. The premium
version is like 2.00 a month and a regular version. You only make socks, and you
can't do the deep focus version. Either way, I've loved the premium and non-
premium version, and it has absolutely no ads. It's an app developed by Hank
Green.  I have a severe phone addiction, and it has helped me an insane amount 
 


 Did you try setting a time limit? I used to spend hours doomscrolling on twitter
until it became a problem, so I tried to change my time limit settings and found
the option to set a password, so now every time I try to ignore the time limit I
have to not only tap an ""ignore limit"" button, but also enter a password, and
seeing the password screen I now have to stop and think about what I'm doing —
usually I end up closing the app because I opened it  mindlessly, not for a
purpose, and was going to lose time there again.  It works for me also because I
use this as a part of my rewarding system — I have to earn my guilt-free
scrolling time by doing my good habits and working on my goals, so knowing I'll
have my scrolling time later makes easier to close the app now. (Though I often
choose having a treat over scrolling when the time comes to get myself a reward,
so my screen time decreased more than I expected). 
 


 I don’t even have to check I’m out of control. I’m going to multitask and listen
to a productivity book on my phone so I can’t pick it up! 
 


 Oh man, I’ve totally been there. Seeing that number just hits different, right?

What was your experience cutting down your screen time or phone addiction,"What was your experience cutting down your screen time or phone addiction

My screen time would usually be 10 hrs per day.   So today is my first day, my
goal was 3 hrs of screen time. The withdrawal was hard. I felt very sleepy and
negative in the morning but throughout the afternoon and night I felt really
good.   And I got most of my chores done and I didn't procrastinate too.   What
was your guys' experience?   I know today was my first day, but maybe hearing
another person's story would keep me motivated.

 I agree with the comment that said time seems slower. I went through a rough
period where I was using my phone 6+ hours a day as a distraction and the weeks
from that time completely blend together. I feel more in control of my life when
I do not use my phone.   Also, studies have shown that having your phone in the
same room as you when you're working decreases productivity because the presence
of your phone (i.e., you knowing its *right there*) takes up cognitive
resources, making you less focused on the current task. One of my main tips is
to put your phone in a totally seperate room when you're working.   Good on you
for making this change! 
 
     Nice add



 Reducing my mobile screen time has made time feel slower.  Previously, a
5-minute break replaced with mobile would turn that 5-minute break into 15–20
minutes of scrolling, adding up to 2–3 hours a day.  Now, without using my
mobile during breaks, spending 5 minutes doing nothing feels slow, which makes
it easy to switch to another task and also saves up 2–3 hours a day, leading to
having so much time left to do something else. 
 


 I went on a dopamine detox streak for like 40 days where I didn’t use my phone
unless I had to take calls or reply to messages.   My phone use was less than 1
hour per day. The first thing I noticed was how easily we get bored without
constant source of dopamine.  The first week was the hardest as I literally just
slept when I didn’t have anything else to do. But after a week, I noticed that I
was able to focus on a lot of pending tasks as I kept putting them off before 
 
     How do I get onto a dopamine detox?



 I don’t have an interesting story to tell you, but good job and keep it up, you
already did great today 
 


 Idk man, if it is not the phone it will be the pc screen or TV. The majority of
my hobbies and things i like spending my free time on, revolve around screens.
That wont change but i agree, cutting down the needless scrolling on the phone
is definitely a good change 
 


 I remember when I tried to reduce my own screen time—I felt restless and missed
the constant scrolling. But after a few days, I started enjoying the little
things more, like reading or just being outside. It's been 5 months now and I
feel more productive. Productivity boost is real! It’s great to hear you tackled
your chores; that sense of accomplishment makes a huge difference. Keep pushing
through! Each day will get easier, and those positive vibes will keep you
motivated. 
 


 I went without a smartphone for a month. It was awesome. I wrote a lot of music
and read a lot more listened to more motivational talks. I naturally went to
sleep earlier vs being up late.    The phone is like the cave of Wonders, so
much glitter and gold we get distracted from our main purpose.  
 
     I went two years without social media, best years of my life. I usually keep social media to remember
    birthdays and to keep track of chess tournaments.

     Then why if it was such a good month, go back to being on a phone constantly? Or, are you not so much?



 Ive had a detox for 6 months and I felt like I had a life. But that was like 4
years ago and nowadays my screen time is back to 2-4 hours.  My mental health
was much better back then just because I didn’t have all the input.  Maybe I
should do this again. I remember it was hard but it was worth it though. 
 


 I typically hit 6-7 a day depending on how much I work.   I’ve done 2 weeks in
the last year with a very strict 2 he a day limit. In both weeks I read 3 books
each lol. And like you said way more chores and other random tasks get done. And
I enjoy movies and sports more because I’m not glancing at my phone. It feel
terrific.   Good for you and keep it up. Good luck! 
 


 One thing that seems to help is whenever getting the urge or finding yourself
surfing Youtube, break it off and step away. Do some chores, grab food or just
lay down to listen some music - I'm using an old Xperia phone as dedicated media
player atm. But make it a bad experience and try to use the PC with more
purpose.  I'm  struggling with this atm too, trying to go analogue with things
like journaling too, not sure it helps yet.

How do you manage cutting screen time with your day to day life?,"How do you manage cutting screen time with your day to day life?

I understand that a big part of procrastination can stem from the general
addictive nature of “doom-scrolling” on your phone and cutting screen time can
greatly produce productivity and overall creativity (no dopamine fried brain).
However, my partner and I use our phones to communicate most of the day as our
schedules are so busy during school we rarely get to see each other face to
face. This is negatively impacting my productivity, even if I spend 30 minutes
just texting I eventually get the craving to go on instagram or yt. How can I
manage this without severing my connection with my partner and sacrificing our
relationship and valuable time together?

 Set downtime hours during the day and allowed apps on my phone to be only key
ones/ for messaging only during the day (no social media). Then discipline. I am
improving but not perfect yet. 
 


 I downloaded an iOS app called screen zen and it’s really helped a lot. It’s
free but they ask for a donation for the programmers as low as $5.  You can pick
the apps, the amount of time for each app, and a number of times you can open
the app each day. Lots of options including a delay opening the app. It also
keeps track of your streak which is a nice incentive. It’s helped a lot. I’ve
had to add it to my iPad as well but baby steps 😅 
 
     I’d tried with screenzen a while ago but really struggled to actually get it to be useful but going to
    give it another go and see how I get on

     screen zen? sound interesting

     I used screen Zen, then I realised I can bypass the facebook block by clicking the F in messenger on the
    top right.



 I mentally tell myself that is so bad that when I do it I feel sick after.. I
only try to make things that are in some way useful for me. Either way is a hard
battle! I did the downtime hours too and it helped but it is also easy to go
over it... 
 


 Selective blocking apps (I have a good luck with ScreenZen) or the tried and
true method: delete the offending apps in the morning (and reinstall them in
your downtime if you like). 
 


 Ugh me too! My partner and I are long distance so we really only can connect
through our phones. They love me to send me memes and stuff on instagram and I
want to connect with them that way but struggle to do so because I want to
reduce my instagram doomscrolling. It's not perfect but I downloaded an app that
makes me specify the duration of time that I want to spend on instagram in each
session. I have found that that's helped to control the time I spend there, and
it feels like a fair compromise between using instagram and reducing my screen
time. 
 


 I like using a smart watch instead of a phone during the day. Since I can still
listen to music and answer calls, I don’t have the same need to pick up my phone
and the watch is less distracting. 
 
     Never used smartwatch . Does the app don’t become a distraction



 Enable grayscaling your screen, works for me, You can still do the work the
phone is supposed to do i.e caliing, texting, making payment or google search,
it will be annoying only for watching content 
 


 Ask yourself, how much screen time(without partner)is enough? Then track it and
adjust. I don’t count anything done with family or friends as a negative except
for video games.   Video games require a more nuanced approach because you can
make a crap ton of loose friendships with people you never meet in person but
they can become like family. If that is true you need an online gaming allowance
of time. But that comes down to the same original question, how much do you
think is enough?  Underrated tip: be thankful that you have control of your
schedule. Revel in the power and own it 
 


 Turn off notifications. It's a huge distraction. Use do not disturb for 8 or 9
hours during the day and you'll notice urself checking it phone way l wayyyy
less. 
 


 I might sound old, but you need to realize that most of this social media is
HORRIBLE.   Most is fake or spammy.  It has zero benefits and just negatives.
Just for the sake of not being completely out of touch with friends etc, I block
30 minutes on my calendar daily (only 30 minutes, blocked!!!!) and spend this
time on social media.  Reddit being the most important part, by the way.  So,
block just 30 min.  cleanse yourslef of this rubbish that is destroying lives.

"How much screen time do you think is ""normal"" these days? Are we all overdoing it?","How much screen time do you think is ""normal"" these days? Are we all overdoing it?

With work, entertainment, and social media all on our phones and laptops  it's
getting harder to tell what’s ""too much"" screen time anymore.   I checked my
phone stats last week and was shocked to see 7+ hours daily (mostly scrolling
reels, YT, and chatting). It didn’t *feel* like I was wasting time… but maybe I
was? Curious to hear from other fellows..How much screen time do you get in a
day? Have you ever tried reducing it? What helped you cut back (if anything)?
Would love to know what others think especially since this feels like such a
silent issue that we just accept as ""normal"" now.

 Helpful to break out into healthy screen time and non-healthy screen time. For
instance if im putting an hour into duolingo then that's fine for me, but if its
an hour doomscrolling then im more concerned. I personally use an app that helps
balance my screen time so I have to earn it. It helps keep my overall unhealthy
time low but still accessible 
 
     Can I ask what app you're using?

     This is a great point.



 Screen time is the new drug abuse now. I have around same screen time. I keep
deleting social media but somehow it gets downloaded again after a few days or
so. Tiktok seems to be more persistent. 
 
     Couldn't agrreeee more!

     So far the only thing that helped me with the endless loop of deleting and downloading tik tok was to
    deactivate my account! I didn’t fully delete the account, I can restart it with my password and
    authorization, but I think mentally it clicked as too much of a hassle. I’ve been without it for about 4-5
    months and don’t miss it. I also did watch YouTube shorts for a bit after, but they’re less interesting. I
    got more focused on watching long videos and shorts in between, but now I don’t really have any desire for
    short form content. 



 It really depends on what you're consuming. My screen time dropped from 6–7
hours to 2–3 just by realizing this: my phone screen was draining me, but my
tablet screen was helping me grow. Big screens like tablets or laptops feel less
private, so you naturally use them more for work. What i recommend, put your
phone in a kitchen drawer for a set time each day.  https://preview.redd.it/6tuf

     thanks for the suggestion!



 Hmm, I used to have about 2 to 3h per day but I think we should put our phone
down and do other thing instead like reading a book or going for a walk.
Something like that.  There was also a time that I constantly used my phone all
day, about 4-5 hours per da,y and I didn't like that at all. So I made a big
change to my lifestyle. I replaced all the activities that I don't like with
something good.  For example like if I rest for about 5-10 minutes I will try to
open a book or write down something rather than scroll in TikTok (I'm still
trying to develop this habit). Of course, tools and system also play big role in
this shift. You have to use the suitable tool and system in order to change your
habit. 
 
     This sounds pretty good, wil try!



 Consider tracking both screen time and number of pickups. The phone pickup has
become default when just passing time. Good habit to break — consider something
as simple as turning phone a different orientation when placing in pocket. That
one change might help jostle the mind to consider whether the phone pickup is
worth it 
 
     You are correct, these days i have observed picking up uncessarily



 3-7 hours depending if you have tiktok installed or not 
 
     In our country, tiktok is banned! haha



 Around a year ago I had an average of 8 hours a day - mostly discord, instagram
and youtube. After deleting instagram, it didn’t fix the issue right away, I
didn’t doomscroll videos on youtube, but I started habitually checking my phone
more often, racking up hours on that habit…   When I changed my phone, I avoided
installing discord and youtube on my phone and leaving them on my ipad, which
resulted in me managing successfuly around 3-3:30 hours average per day. But
when I’d have around 3 hours of use time, it felt like I didn’t use my phone at
all since I was either answering messages or looking things up. And also I
didn’t count my time spent on ipad, which just mitigated a problem from one
device to another.   Now few weeks ago I’ve reinstalled discord and youtube
back, and with it I came back to high averages 6-7 hours. Mathematically
speaking watching few videos of like half an hour can give you 2 hours so
quickly without you realising it. And discord being a social platform for
talking, it can also give you an hour just like when texting.   In the end, it’s
either trying to placebo yourself with moving your time spent consuming or
talking to other devices, or simply cutting it out if it brings you no worth,
happiness or joy.   I feel it’s not only about how many hours are spent on a
phone if you’re making up for it by watching TV or youtube on other devices.
Even if you work from phone as well, you are spending time on it. But I’d say
under 4 hours a day would be ideal if I could return back to it, counting all my
consumption as well in that.  
 
     Cool!!! Thanks for sharing your experience!



 I was around 7 hours on my phone at one point, and as a uni student I was at
around 6-9 hours on my laptop a day too.  I don't care about my laptop time bc I
genuinely stick to that as productive, also I'll have been using my phone during
that time too so it's double counted.  It was only till I started using an app
that displays daily usage time as a popup over other apps to be mindful in the
moment of my screentime, I could never stick to app blockers!  It's called
""screentime overlay"" on Google play 
 
        OKAY! Thanks for sharing this!



 Depends on what you do for a living. I'm a remote worker. My job requires me to
use a laptop and phone.  Still, I try to maintain a balance. I avoid screens the
first and last hour of being awake. When possible, I try to use my notebook or
take a meeting over the phone to give my eyes a break from the screen. 
 


 I want to make sure that when I look back on the day or week, I know I spent my
time wisely. I only have Instagram on my phone and have it limited to 45 minutes
a day. I don't do a ton of texting (I'm an introverted elder millenial) and tend
to watch YouTube to learn something, like installing or fixing something on my
house.   I have hobbies and want to make sure I'm getting to them so I do try to
make sure that I'm aware of how I'm spending time. It's super easy to get
distracted these days, and awareness takes a higher importance I'd say, than
previous times.

This changed my life — 9 hrs/day to 2 hrs/day doom scrolling,"This changed my life — 9 hrs/day to 2 hrs/day doom scrolling

I'm embarrassed to admit it… but I've been averaging 9 hours a day on my phone
for a while (mostly reels)… it literally kills my productivity and social life.
Honestly it didn't even feel like that much. It just kind of happens…  * Wake
up: scroll (1+ hr) * Eat breakfast/lunch: on my phone (1+ mins) * Evening: watch
TV while on my phone (3 hrs) * Lay down for bed: scroll (1+ hrs) * Wake up in
middle of night: scroll (1+ hrs) * Plus using throughout the day (2 hrs)  I
decided to commit (hard) to making a change… basically go cold turkey... and
follow a lot of the advice I've seen on reddit...  **1) Hard limit of 1 hour on
Insta**   Once I use up the hour, I can't even open Insta. I didn't want to
completely delete it because I use it to communicate with friends and I wanted
to see if I could still use it but not obsessively.  **2) Turned on grayscale**
I hate it, and don't always leave it on… but it works when I do it. It makes
your phone way less addicting, and boring to use even on the addicting apps.
**3) Completely block Insta and social from 7pm to 7am**   I racked up a lot of
time while watching TV, and in the middle of the night, and in the morning — all
of it was time I regretted. I still let myself watch TV at night, but at least
I'm not double screening and I'm focused on just the TV which feels much more
relaxing.  **4) Find better replacements**   This was a important one for me.
Replacing scrolling with things I'd rather do (read, play guitar, call friends,
study, etc).  * I have a lot of books I have ordered but never read, so I'm
keeping a book next to me to fill the small times. * I love playing music and
writing music but my guitar was collecting dust. Just playing guitar a few times
a day puts me in a much more creative and relaxed mood. * I'm calling my friends
who I have not talked to in a while. * And, I'm learning new things (in
moderation). It's so easy to bombard ourselves with too much information, so I'm
picking less things and going deep on them with whatever gets me excited, and
with no attachment.

 I'm deadass about to get a flip phone. I'm so frustrated by how much time I
waste on apps and short form media. It's getting to a point where I don't even
watch TV shows anymore because my attention span can't handle it. Thanks for the
advice! 
 
     That is so true. It's crazy how TV starts to feel ""boring"" because we are so used to the short form
    videos... I'm trying to retrain my brain to actually enjoy TV more lol. Cutting down on the doom scrolling
    does seem to help, I'm enjoying the TV shows more now

     [removed]

     My only problem with this is my office works requires me to use WhatsApp and I don't think a flip phone
    would help with that, and if it does then it'll also have other apps too which would mean wasting my time
    on the same phone

     Made the switch a few weeks back and now my phone usage is down to less than an hour a day. Best decision
    ever.

     I actually used a flip phone for about 2 weeks recently and there are some gaps you have to fill with
    other devices (bringing your smartphone along to bluetooth to your car and having to have pre-downloaded
    music, starting gps/maps before you leave and following the route perfectly, certain message formatting is
    messy, having to switch SIM card every once in a while to do certain things you want to) but it was a huge
    relief. Once I gave the phone back I felt disgusted having to touch my phone and carry it in my pocket. If
    you have any questions I’d be happy to answer, I think the  person I borrowed it from said it was about
    $200. I intend to get one of my own in the near future.      Edit: I also deleted socials like snapchat
    (everyone says they’re afraid to lose their memories but I just spent a couple hours going through my
    pictures and saving them to my phone, then backed them up on google photos) tiktok (tiktok has since made
    it so you can’t view videos sent by other people unless you have the app but it doesn’t devalue life to
    not know every tiktok reference in the world, plus so many of them end up on other platforms anyways), and
    instagram a couple years ago and it did so much for my mental and screen time. I highly recommend
    whittling down all the copycat-social media apps to the ones that keep you off of them or just to one to
    communicate with people. 

     I also recommend the app ScreenZen. It can block apps for a specific amount of time, which you can
    determine and/or after a specific amount of times you opened the app. You can also set up certain
    conditions to open the apps, like doing a minute of breathing exercises, while you think about if you
    really want to spend time on instagram, do word puzzles or walk 1 km. It’s been really helpful for
    reducing my time on Instagram and Reddit

     I recommend brick, it’s a physical device that bricks the apps you set up (can have different modes with
    different apps) and you need to tap the phone to the device to “unbrick” them. You get 5 emergency remote
    unbricks with the device. Other than that there’s no way to disable the brick without physical access to
    the device. So you can leave the brick at home, at work, in another room, in your car, give it to a friend
    or partner…whatever you need. It has helped me SO much.

 Personally I’ve taken up knitting. Every time I want to reach for the phone I
reach for my project on the coffee table instead. 
 
     That's awesome. Nice job! Love that idea. I've never knitted but it looks relaxing and kind of zen tbh

     Show us your work 😄



 Damn I got almost 11 hours average. And I told myself to study today but ended
up just using social media and games all day again 
 
     I totally understand how you feel. You got this! But also, don't beat yourself up too bad when you slip...
    it's a process but it's so worth it to find a better balance.



  Thank you for posting this. I genuinely feel like I just scroll and don't take
in any information and feel so silly about it. You've inspired me to try and
make a change. Thank you Op 
 
     I know that feeling for sure. Good luck!



 lowkey does anyone else still have screen time issues even when blocking social
media? i swear it feels like i could delete all the apps on my phone and still
somehow manage to rack up 7 hours on texting and notes app alone lol :/ i guess
it’s the way my brain has been wired at this point but switching to a flip phone
isn’t an option and i’m kind of at a loss at this point 
 
     Are you actively using those apps all that time or do you just leave your screen open on them to reference
    or reply occasionally?



 I think my biggest hang up is I don’t know what else to do with my spare time 
 
     That's an important phase to go through.  That boredom will reveal your interests and passions because
    you're with yourself.  Don't replace it with another distraction like tv or something plz.  Just sit with
    pen and paper for hours and write down ideas if nothing else. It'll reveal your inner self.

     Get an ereader app and find a series you can dig into! It's a slow way to chip away at the phone habit,
    but at least you're doing better than melting your brain with short-form videos

     If you don’t workout or go to the gym, I recommend getting that into your routine! You’ll naturally not
    use your phone and you’ll feel more productive. That productivity breeds more productive eventually. It’s
    amazing.

     There is going to be an uncomfortable couple weeks where you just need to lean into the boredom. Sit with
    the boredom for a bit and ideas will come to you



 [removed] 
 
     Lol I know that feeling all too well



 I might implement this too...i literally feel like throwing my phone away, once
I realise the amount of time i spent just doom scrolling. 
 
     Good luck! It’s crazy once you start paying close attention to it! So hard to balance but worth it for
    sure!



 Omg this is embarrassing- my daily average is 13hrs and the other day it was
20hrs… I really appreciate your tips, and seeing this post motivated me to
delete my socials and anything else that’s not helping me!

Advice or app to reduce screen time,"Advice or app to reduce screen time

I am looking for an app that will help me decrease my screentime , by providing
rewards or making using my phone miserable idc I just need help with my screen
time  Your help is much appreciated

 Use ""Forest"" to gamify focus, or ""Opal"" to block apps during certain hours. Also
charge your phone in another room 
 
     Then youuuu



 Do you have an iPhone? There is an option in there to limit your screen time. 
 
     Unfortunately no Android , specificity Huawei



 Have you tried deleting the apps that are wasting your time? 
 
     Yes I only have chess , browser for scrolling through Reddit sometimes , and the essentials , I also have
    my phone in grayscale mode



 I use ScreenZen. I either have to do a wordle to open an app or wait a certain
amount of seconds. It's helped lose any interest using any apps. You can also
change the amount of time to wait too or have it make you do math problems to
unlock it. Another thing I do is just delete apps from my Home Screen and have
it automatically turn greyscale when I open certain apps. 
 
     How do you do the automatic greyscale thing?



 Another vote for Forest.  I use free version.   I also deactivated or at least
uninstalled all distracting apps & only use web versions (they have reduced
functionality on web, so can’t doomscroll).   Greyscale is good and setting up
time limits for apps too. I mean i ignore them often, but having to type
pin/over-ride every few mins, gets annoying, so i put the phone down
eventually.  
 


 ScreenZen 
 


 What if you could make your smart phone dumb? Turn on grayscale to reduce the
visual addiction. Turn off notifications for every social media app. There are
Digital Wellbeing apps you could try too.  I was wasting too much time on
scrolling reels last year. So I tried using app blockers, of which [Scroll Break
](https://scrollbreak.vgotchastudio.space/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&u
tm_campaign=launch) worked the best for me.  It requires you to select how long
you plan on using an addictive app in order to unlock it. After the set time is
over, a block screen prevents you from using all the restricted apps for 5
minutes (cooldown period).  It's not a permanent app blocker, just lets you be
in charge of your digital habits by setting time limits in real-time based on
your current situation.  Apart from that, it's important to replace your free
time/ empty time with something creative/ productive otherwise you'll end up
checking your phone again or doomscrolling. 
 
     Thank you so much , I will probably fill my free time with more reading

"You're Not Lazy, You're Dopamine-Depleted (Part 2): Real Steps That Actually Work - Trust Me, I've Tested Them All","You're Not Lazy, You're Dopamine-Depleted (Part 2): Real Steps That Actually Work - Trust Me, I've Tested Them All

 After my last post about dopamine depletion resonated with so many of you, I
wanted to share the practical steps that actually helped me rewire my brain. No
theoretical fluff – just real, tested methods from someone who's been in the
trenches.  Let me be real with you: implementing these changes wasn't smooth
sailing. There were days I fell back into old patterns, moments of frustration,
and times I questioned if it was worth it. But looking back now, these
strategies fundamentally changed how I approach life and productivity.  Here's
what actually worked for me:  * Morning Sanctuary: I replaced the instant phone
grab with 30 minutes of peace. Just water, window gazing, and letting my mind
settle. The first week was torture – my hand would literally twitch toward my
phone. Now? It's the most peaceful part of my day. The urge to check
notifications eventually fades, I promise.  * Movement Medicine: Skip the
intense workout pressure. I discovered that simple movement – like walking
without podcasts or dancing badly while making breakfast – gives me a more
sustainable dopamine boost than endless doomless scrolling ever did. Your body
literally rewards you for basic movement, no gym membership required.  * Real
Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly
uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our
screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human
connection hits different when you're fully present.  * Analog Joy: Found myself
picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about
creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a
journal, or building something – tangible activities give you that dopamine hit
without the digital drain.  * Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't
designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I
actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like
training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.  * Evening Rituals:
Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes
blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my
thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy.
Here's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never
enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the
other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay.
Remember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with
yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts.  Drop a comment about which
strategy you're going to try first – let's keep supporting each other on this
journey.  Edit: Since some of you asked – yes, this is all from personal
experience. The struggles, the setbacks, and the small wins are all real. Thanks
for creating this space where we can have honest conversations about something
we all face.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

 Dopamine depletion can make you feel lazy, but restoring balance is possible.
Set small goals, avoid distractions, exercise regularly, and practice
mindfulness to boost motivation and regain energy over time. 
 
     Well put.

     Idk how small are goals supposed to be. Cos then I feel like I'm not doing as much as I'm supposed to be
    able to and then push myself to the point of breaking. Any advice on that?



 What’s your morning routine like? I feel like for most of us it starts with an
alarm going off on our phone and from that point it’s a given that we start
looking at notifications etc. 
 
     Hey thats part 3! Spoiler alert I like the robin sharma method of the 20/20/20 First 20 minutes some sort
    of activity preferably that you sweat. Secondly reflection in yourself, journal or meditation. Lastly
    study a skill or a book that intrests you. More on that in two days🫶🏻

     I bought a $15 alarm clock for exactly this reason. Phone charges in the living room overnight, and
    doesn’t get picked up until I’m done with the rest of my morning routine. Makes a huge difference.

     If you’re consistent enough you shouldn’t need an alarm to wake up. Sometimes you will but I wake up at
    the same time as long as I can get sleep in 1.5 hour increments. 7.5 is ideal but 3 is sufficient even
    without an alarm. 



 My dopamine is so depleted I couldn't even finish reading your whole post let
alone finish typing a r

     [removed]



 Those things sound helpful but how do you actually consistently do/enforce them?
Seems impossible to me. If I make changes like this, I can force myself to
follow the rules for two weeks max, then it's back to the dopamine binge... 
 
     Start small. Implement habits one after another yes boring and takes time but such is long term change.
    Stay consistent  Morning routine is the first step in my opinion.



 Your evening ritual is very very relatable, I read a book before I just fall
asleep and have to say the quality of my sleep is amazing. Thanks for sharing
this schedule. 
 


 Thank you man. I been struggling with this for a while and I was praying today
for wisdom. I am struggling right now since I put down weed and cigarettes. I am
fighting like hell to step away from it and some of these tips like using hand
activities is great 
 
     Good luck. Addiction especially smoking takes time, dont be hard on yourself, that is crucial DONT BEAT
    Yourself up if you trip once or twice try again and again until you will succeed.



 thanks bro

Basically I want to set a daily limit on my phone and generally have a block

AppBlock but I need a subscription for the above.

 Stay free is the best one for sure  
 
     “Steptime” is pretty good cause it makes you walk to earn screen time

 screen zen 
 


 If you have an iPhone, I believe Apple natively support this with Screen Time
(settings) 
 


 built in screen time limits? 
 


 If you’re using iphone, built-in screentime is very handy. Ask your friend or
someone close to set the password for you so you won’t override it. That’s what
I did. 
 


 On iPhone there’s screen time controls built in 
 


 I personally use Microsoft family safety. As far as I'm aware, it's free, though
I personally have a family 365 subscription.   1. Create a Microsoft account.
Set the password to something complex enough that you can't memorize it. Write
that password down on a piece of paper. This account will be your administrator
account. 2. Inside of Microsoft family safety (website or phone app) create a
child account. You can set the age to whichever you prefer, the only difference
is that if you create an adult account, you can decide at any time to stop being
monitored, so I set it to 13 so that I don't have that option. 3. Install the
Microsoft family safety app on your devices, and on Windows you have to log into
that account separately.  This gives you screen time controls on windows, xbox,
android and iphones. You can also restrict the time spent on specific
applications or apps, or completely block them. Additionally you can block
websites. I'm not sure if you can set time limits or usage windows on websites.
Tangentially, it also helps if you're trying to quit certain bad habits by
turning on web filters, though it requires the edge browser in all cases. It
will block most popular browsers if you want it to, to force you to use the edge
browser.  One caveat on your phone is that it is difficult to access the family
safety controls if you have the phone set up as a child account. You'll have to
log into the administrator account from a computer... i think? Might be possible
to set up a second profile on your phone.

Need help reducing screen time,"Need help reducing screen time

My screen time is averaging at 9-11 hours daily.  And I spend 37 hours on social
media …this week how do I reduce this??

 If you're on Android, use Digital Wellbeing and setup strict timers for social
media. 10 minutes probably.  It helped me immensely. 
 
     Any apps for iPhone users?



 I noticed how bad my phone habit was when my phone was off, and I still tapped
the screen like five times a minute. this is crazy! it's like muscle memory.  I
tried screen time limits, grey icons, didn’t help much. So I deleted a few apps,
muted messages, turned off most notifications, changed my lock screen, and
started putting my phone away or not carrying it around all the time.  now my
social media screen time is around 14 hours per week. 
 


 I used AppBlock before, and it helped me reduce my screen time.   If possible,
it’s also better to use a separate device for studying or work. 
 


 Hey, there are a lot of things you could do, I would love to help you with this
problem since i was in the same boat as you. For me getting someone to set a
screen time password for me worked wonders. And also doing a dopamine detox is
something which would drastically improve your life but that is for after. As i

"Looking for a ""*free* app to limit screen time","Looking for a ""*free* app to limit screen time

As it says on the tin - looking for a reliable free app to limit screen time.
Was on a really good streak until a few months ago when it all went downhill as
I've moved abroad and use social media to feel connected to the UK, where I'm
from. But its gotten out of hand. I would prefer not to get rid of it entirely
so will need to resort to limiting how much time I spend on it. Any
recommendations for free apps to help with this? I've seen plenty of paid ones
but honestly dont need anything fancy. I'm old and don't need to try to figure
out additional features.

 I use ScreenZen, it allows you to put different messages and is overall very
customizable. My favourite feature is the math one. I set myself the setting,
that i have to do 30 seconds of math equasions before being able to open social
media apps (or just the reel tab) for 5 minutes. Now i improved my math skills
but it is much less tempting to open them at all. You can also just block
specific things like reels or shorts without blocking the whole app. 
 
     thanks - does it just do regular blocking or setting a daily limit? really dont want anything super
    customisable or needing to do math equations.

     ScreenZen is the best!

     Sólo que no es gratis



 I like Opal, but it's currently for iPhones only 
 
     And it’s $100!!!!



  I totally relate to this, moving abroad can really crank up the social media
usage just to stay connected. If you're looking for a clean, free solution,
definitely try out Jolt. It’s a minimal, no-fuss app that helps you set daily
limits on apps, block distracting ones when needed, and even track your usage
trends. What I really like is that it doesn’t overwhelm you with too many
features, just the right amount of control to stay intentional.  I’ve been using
it for a few weeks now and it’s helped me rebuild my screen time boundaries
without forcing me to quit cold turkey. Might be just what you need! 
 
     thanks very much. is it free to use?

     Thanks



 I like screen zen. It lets you add a timer to opening specific apps so you get a
chance to ask yourself if you really need to open it right now, it can limit app
use to time, or to number of opens per day, as well as interrupt you after a set
time period to ask you if you really want to continue spending time on the app.
I think it works pretty great, and it was helpful to me in cutting down on time,
but really, no app is going to solve the real issues with app overuse. 
 
     this sounds great. do you know if the app is free to use?



 I use Opal, it’s pretty good works as expected 
 


 Social media’s comforting until it hijacks your time. Try
\*\*iKeyMonitor\*\*—it’s simple and free for basic screen time limits. Also,
your phone’s built-in \*\*Digital Wellbeing\*\* (Android) or \*\*Screen Time\*\*
(iOS) can do the trick without the bells and whistles. 
 
     thank you - I might have locked myself out of screen time.



 I use the LockMyApps iPhone app and pretty much use it every day at work at this
point.  I tried Opal, ScreenZen, and all of the other top screen time control
apps and I think the LockMyApps app is the easiest to use (and has way more
features vs the other apps).   I hope it helps.  Side note:  If you set a goal,
don't be discouraged if it takes a few weeks to finally break your doom
scrolling habit.  If you fail, just keep at it and try again.  Good luck, OP

rewards you for not using your phone, and you can block certain apps

Hi guys, i am entering now in a ""trying to throw my phone off"" phase, when i try
to reduce the maximus my screen time and lazynes, so i can be more productive in
life, for now started used color filters (the black and white of IOS),
uninstalled some apps like ytb instagram, and now i'm seeing that i'm replacing
these two for the reddit, that i didn't even get downloaded app and just using
the google one, in the site, and i'm still losing a lot of time in he doing
nothing useful. Today i started testing some blockers/focus apps like Opal and
Forest and i see some future using them.  So, my real question is, if it did
have some app/extension that i can use in the android/ios and pc, and, the most
important part to me (cause even in pc i catch myself scrolling it), some that
can literally remove the ytb shorts/reels, principally shorts cause instagram i
didn't use that much (even think of deleting my account completely). It can be
more than one actually, one to use versus the Shorts, another to counter the
Reels, and well, for the timer and focus thing i see that forest and opal get pc
versions, so the timer thing still theres. Also i forgot it to mention,
something that can disable links it's pretty good too, like for reddit and
others social text sites (letterboxd and more).  Sorry bad english 🇧🇷

 Oi, tudo bem? 👋  I had the same problem with wasting time on shorts/reels. A few
tools that really helped me:  * Unhook (Chrome/Firefox extension) → removes
YouTube shorts, suggestions, comments. * Focus To-Do (Android/iOS/PC) → combines
Pomodoro timer + site/app blocker. * Opal (iOS) or Freedom (iOS/Android/PC) →
blocks apps + websites across all devices. * LeechBlock (Firefox) / StayFocusd
(Chrome) → block specific sites or pages (ex: Reddit frontpage, Insta reels).
Extra tip: instead of deleting apps, block only the “infinite scroll” parts
(shorts/reels feed). That way you can still use them for useful stuff.  Boa
sorte 🍀 — é uma batalha, mas cada bloqueio faz diferença! 
 
     Opa, valeu meu brother, really really thank you, it's an gold comment with that suggestions, into options
    to extensors and apps, really thank you man

 Regain does this but it might be mobile only

 I use StayFree on Android and set it to block Reels and FB videos. 
 
     i downloaded it on IOS, but it did want it acess to safari and other stuff, i find it weird and i didn't
    enjoy the design too (seems similar to others i tested like Opal and Jomo). Now i tried o uninstall it and
    i just can not do it, it only got the option to hide the app, can you help me to remove he? really don't
    going to use it and is using storage, please help bro 



 For iOS you dont need apps, the screentime in the settings itself will allow you
to setup limits, which similar to most apps try to offer.   For the PC/Browser,
check the list by the other user No_Respond6706  Despite all, you wont be able
to stick to it, just because an app tells you to 'stop' 'enough' you are not
going to listen to it anyway.   The permanant solution is not to stop something,
instead start something else.  You will be better off if you become a content
creator instead of consumer. Try it like this record 5 minutes of your random
talk and start posting in your newly created IG or TT account. Then slowly you
get the dopamine to read the comments in your own content and you will be
occupied in responding and making more content  Other things you can start are:
- new gym or fitness routine - outdoor sports like muaythai or hiking  - build a
business or side hustle that you always wanted, do it not for money, just as an
experiment to study where it takes you.  - adopt a pet or have a child something
along the line - commit for a community work  The idea is you can stop
something, you can only replace something with something else. 
 
     i really agree with you, but for now i'm searching these apps and thing to make like a first step, i
    really don't think it will change all my life, but if it reduces minimum the half of time i use the phone,
    it's really worth it, and then i will be evolving to other stuff to do like you said



 [removed] 
 
     I'm on the IOS using the Opal and Jomo for now (really in doubt for what of the 2 i stay in the phone and
    which one i remove it) and forest to as an study timer, really great too, now for the extensors i'm still
    looking straight, someone to answer it the post with an list of extensors that seens great too

Does anyone know an app that can block just the app and leave the website alone?

 If you use an Android phone, you can set time limits for apps in the Digital

Might be under parental controls.  You could also just uninstall the app
completely if you don't want to use it at all. 
 


 Opal 
 


 Yes! The best ones with no bypassing in my opinion are [Apple Configurator
2](https://youtu.be/ifqMXN1c-Nc) for iPhone, you can go two ways, either choose
all the apps you want and therefore it will block the rest or just add reddit in
the blocklist. The use some digital lockbox to hide the password so you can't
just make changes whenever you want.  For Android
[Andoff](https://youtu.be/ZkvegbwLAOM) should be enough but if you want to get
fancy use [HeartGuard](https://youtu.be/eJY7bjFS74Y) along side as it.

 If you're on Mac: Hyud   If you're on iOS: Opal is the most famous one but the

 Screentime is not the problem, what you're watching is. If you're using mobile
for sixteen hours and it's mostly work related and useful stuff then there is no
problem at all.  Watching reels and consuming meaningless content is a problem
but if you ain't doing all that, keep going you don't need to be concerned at
all. Just turn on the eye protection or change the color to red to protect your
eyes. 
 


 No, day has 24h 
 


 6 hours is a lot, you’re basically looking at a screen for your entire waking
day. 
 
     The post says 16, which is worse



 That is too much. 
 


 Insanityyyyyy 
 


 It's fine, I don't see anything wrong with it 
 


 To do classes, assignments, projects, and business, you will usually need to be
on a screen of some sort. You're only going to get screen time down if you get
work or productive time down and free resting time up, which you might not want
to do for a large variety of reasons. 
 


 Make sure you get at least 8 hours of sleep after using the mobile phone. 
 


 This is burnout waiting to happen.   You need to have sleep, wash, eat, take
some exercise as well as breaks. This alone would reduce your screen time to 12
(which is still bonkers btw).  Perhaps take a few things analogue to help. Note
taking, flash cards etc work well analogue. Maybe read real books instead of on
a device.   You still need some R&R though.

movie   - Cook a meal   - Take a walk   - Paint or draw   - Meditate    In the

 This is a good list. But the activity I want to do actually ends up involving a

or getting distracted. 
 
     Yes, this is why I went back to reading paper books.

     that’s where you can use plugins to block websites!

     Perhaps that is best left as late as possible in the day so there's only time to watch a udemy video and
    that's it

     You on windows?  I recall using a program that, at times I set, would block all programs instead of the
    ones I whitelisted  This is 5 years ago and I do not remember its name sadly

     Meditate and read Atomic Habits. Helped me a lot.

     You draw the animations on a stack of paper then vigorously flip the pages! Really relaxing!

     Not exactly the answer you’re looking for, but I’ve started watching more movies at night as it stops me
    from binging TV as much. A movie is equal to 2-2.5 45 min episodes.

     Personally, watching a movie without also scrolling on my phone would be a success.



 Thank you. Some of the problems:  1. I read books on the phone 2. I write
journal on desktop (online) 3. I follow yoga sessions on the phone 4. I watch a
movie on desktop 5. I plan the day online  Luckily, there are many things I do
outside or without any sort of technology. Even if I do use screen in these
activities, it's still highly valuable. 
 
     These are all personal choices that you have decided to make. They are all under your control.
    Alternatives for each.  1. check out physical books from your local library.  2. Get a physical journal.
    Consider bullet journalling.  3. Learn a yoga routine and play music yourself.   4. Don't watch movies
    alone or watch them on the TV.  5. Plan your day... on an actual planner.   Not that long ago one had to
    do everything in the physical world. Now I wouldn't go back to that time because there where so many
    things wrong with the world, but some things where better: fewer distractions/expectations. You had the
    personal agency without the constant information overload was a god send.   You can take control of your
    live. I believe in you.



 Watch a movie without a screen? :D 
 
     I bought the cheapest home projector because I wanted to watch some tv shows at the end of the day but my
    eyes were already tired after 8+ hours of screentime for work. Best decision I took in a while. Now I'm
    thinking of upgrading it to a more expensive projector of better quality.



 I really need to work on this… 
 


 Just stop social media.. you'll be instantly 100% productive 😅😅

 If watching a movie I recommend doing something with your hands to keep you

journalling is just inferior for me and I can never stick to it

 First of all, I’d suggest when you delete most used apps, leave the most boring
one on your phone. For example, delete instagram and YouTube but leave something
more text oriented, like twitter or Reddit. Text oriented stuff tends to make a
lot less of a dopamine hit when you use them and it can make the progress much
easier. There is also an alternative way, a little less difficult but also less
progressful, which is trying to forward your attention from short form of
content to longer ones, for example movies or TV series.  Second of all, you
must find something else that gives you some kind of dopamine boost but is not
on your phone. That will give your nervous system a way to still get dopamine by
doing something but move your attention from being on screen all the time  And
finally, and this is true generally, not only for this case, do not bully
yourself when it gets hard or you fail, failing is just one step to success in
anything, it will happen. The more you bully yourself, the less you tend to
accept another lifestyle and change in even a positive way. I tried getting of
from social networks and quick dopamine addiction for a year until I started
seeing that it doesn’t consume a lot of my free time, which included both
deleting apps and installing them again, failing and trying again. Believe in
yourself, believe that you can live in a lifestyle that you want and eventually
this will become truth 
 
     But what if you're addicted to Reddit, but not YouTube?

     I think this is the way



 > you can even try bullying me into feeling bad about myself until i quit  I
will confess that when my patience is short with folks who can't stop looking at
their phones, I remind myself that they're essentially shooting themselves in
the footsies.  I remind myself that these are ""hard times"".  The world is
heading towards autocracy, protectionism with Climate Change Chaos disrupting
food supplies.  AI is cutting down the number of jobs available. Competition is
spiking.  So, really, why in the world should I even ""nudge"" online strangers to
be better competition?  Hell, apparently a LOT of them don't even know how
incredibly useful just carrying a pocket notebook and pen is. 
 


 Use browser with no signed in accounts The recommended posts are meh so I'm not
distracted. Youtube gives me blank pages. 
 


 Change phone to black and white. Becomes much less interesting to look at
regardless of the app. 
 
     Greyscale (settings - colour filters - greyscale)



 bought an e reader and gave myself reasonable screentime limits on my phone
locked behind a password only someone else knows. I plan on cutting it even
shorter in a few weeks. 
 


 You unplug, touch grass, and talk to others as if there were no technology.  I
faced the same issue before, glued to my phone and laptop the moment I woke up.
All of my devices only rest when I rest. But when you shift to conventional
methods, that's when you will realize everything is just distractions.  Not
saying technology or any productivity method or apps are not good. Start with
the basics and use those tools (methods or apps) to adapt to technology while
keeping your screen time to a minimum.  Since I have been going to my businesses
physically, the drive time, car or bike, is enough (2-3 hours) to detox me while
still having technology to help me navigate on the shortest route possible. 
 


 I have set up timers for all social media apps. 10 minutes per day for each app.
App automatically gets paused for the rest of the day once the time is over. 
 


 The only thing that worked for me was creating friction before I could open my
time wasting apps. I moved them into a hidden folder on a separate screen,
removed all shortcuts, and logged out each time. The extra 15 seconds to log in
was just enough to make me think “do I really want to do this?” and most of the
time I didn’t. 
 


 Read Digital Minimalism. Very good book 
 


 try opal, adds friction and limits to apps and websites

How to reduce screen time? No concentration!,"How to reduce screen time? No concentration!

I’m really wanting to reduce my screen time, whenever I have 5 minutes free I
seem to reach for my phone - especially social media. I literally go in order -
Facebook, Reddit, insta.   I used to be such an avid reader, but now I can’t
seem to get into books. I’d love to get into all the classic books but it’s like
my concentration is gone.   I’m not crafty at all- crochet, sewing etc just
isn’t my thing.   What do you do when you want to reach for your phone?

 You have a few options  1) Cold Turkey - block all your distracting phone apps
and give a close family member the password so you can't unblock them   2)
Gradual reduction - limit phone time to a certain number, say 1 hour at first,
then decrease by 10 minutes each week. Stop at a number you think is healthy  3)
Earn your time - instead of having a hard limit on how much screen time you get,
allow yourself to earn screen time by doing the things you want to do (here it
would be reading classics). For example - Earn 1 minute of screen time for every
5 minutes of reading 
 


 You might want to limit your screen time or limit certain social apps, even
Reddit.  I am using Stay Free but there are plenty others. 
 


 Honestly, me personally? I generally just do whatever I'm going to do on the
computer. It totally satisfies the urge in my experience.  It's always hard to
say like, what's a realistic way of handling it which is what I suspect is more
what you're asking. And then, that's an awfully big question. It's hard to say.
I guess I think like, just doing the stuff you do on the phone on the computer
is totally realistic though it may not satisfy ""everyone's"" goal. But I do think
it's realistic! 
 
     I think doing useful tasks on the computer is easier compared to trying to do useful tasks on the phone.
    For example - Spreadsheets - I think are just too unwieldy on the phone.  I also think that the phone's
    ""one app at a time"" makes addictions easier to form and thus harder to break.



 I read somewhere that letting natural light hit your eyes first thing before
looking at your phone screen can help start to break that dependency. It's
worked for me at least. So what I do first thing is get out of bed and open my
windows and just look outside, take in the world. I found that I want to reach
for my phone less when I do this. Won't fix anything magically, but it's a
simple thing to add to your routine that might change things. 
 


 It is envy and it should be fought against like the disease of envy. Replace the
addiction or habit with another habit that is less evil.  Take a fidget toy with
buttons and every time take a toy instead of a phone. 
 


 I'm in the same boat! I used to read so many books like a fish in water...now
I've broken that ability. It's crazy!   I saw a really good suggestion that
rather than trying to reduce screen TIME (which is hard), be more deliberate
about what you are going to DO when you pick up your phone. So make a little
mini plan, like you are going to watch 3 videos on Topic X, or read 10 random
reddit posts, or post comments to five friends on Facebook, etc.    And give
priority to screen time that involves longer content, like longer videos, whole
podcasts, ebooks, full articles rather than snippy media posts about those
articles, deep dive single-topic websites, etc. You might still access them in
five minute increments, but you're still retraining yourself to give more time
to a given content, instead of the rapid fire jumping around that's so easy on
social media.   I've also found it useful to do audiobooks to start getting used
to that longform focus on an entire book. It helps to be doing some busywork,
arts/crafts, or simple exercises while listening. 
 


 Uninstall the social media apps and install a book app on your phone and there
on your front view. 
 


 I totally get this—it's like your brain just goes on autopilot! One thing that
helped me was putting my phone in another room, even just for 20–30 minutes. At
first, it feels weird, but it really helps you be more present. I also started
reading super short chapters or easy-to-read books just to build my focus back
slowly. It’s all about small wins that build your concentration again over time! 
 


 Change your phone to greyscale (feels absolutely disgusting to use)   I also
uninstalled those apps and have to go into my phone browser to get to those
sites (which also means no ads!) 
 


 I used to have severe screen addiction. Here's what worked for me:  First a
foremost, **I downgraded my smart phone to a dumb phone**. Internet activity is
only reserved to when I use my computer at home or at a local library. It is
surprising how many tools we place on phones that can be inexpensively delegated
to less predatory devices or tools. Once I downgraded, I got my mind and
attention back - I am now a much more active reader as a result.  Secondly, **go
into the settings of the social media platforms and remove their ability to save
your information**. Part of the problem of social media platforms is that they
gather a bunch of data about you, then use that data to curate an experience
that will continue to get you hooked.  Thirdly, **install apps or web extensions
to make them more boring, harder to use, or less satisfying to look at**.
There's countless out there.  If you want more detailed advice, I'd recommend
reading or listening to the book Atomic Habits by James Clear :) 
 
     would you be open to a product / service that was designed for you to use it less?

This 30-day dopamine detox reset my brain and changed my life,"This 30-day dopamine detox reset my brain and changed my life

I've experimented a bit over the past 6 months with various ways to cut back on
doom scrolling. I came across a few reddit posts that inspired me to try things
like a 24-hour detox, or even 10 days cutting back. It worked, but then my
screen time tended to fluctuate a lot afterwards.  I saw some posts about the
idea of a 30 day plan. Having 4 separate weekly plans made it more digestible.
In case it's helpful, wanted to share. Random Redditors have given me pretty
good inspiration to make changes so maybe I can do the same.  This was my
strategy:      \- First, each Sunday I would pick out a few productive things
for the week that I would use to replace my mindless scrolling and track it (ex:
reading, steps walked, calls made to family, etc). Then the next Sunday I could
review what I accomplished with that time and revamp the plan (was very
motivating and eye opening).  \- The second part of the strategy was adding a
lot of friction to my phone usage. I know if I don't have boundaries I'll slip.
**Week 1:**   \- 25 unblocks of social media per day   \- Morning and evening
phone downtime (unblock as many times as I want for up to 15 minutes)   \-
Target of 120 phone pickups/day   \- Used grayscale manually      \- Result: 7
hrs/day, 123 pickups/day (7 hours gained)     **Week 2:**   \- 20 unblocks of
social media per day   \- Morning and evening phone downtime (unblock as many
times as I want for up to 15 minutes)   \- Target of 100 phone pickups/day   \-
Used grayscale manually      \- Result: 5.5 hrs/day, 102 pickups/day (17 hours
gained)     **Week 3:**   \- 10 unblocks of social media per day   \- Morning
and evening phone downtime (unblock 3x for up to 15 minutes)   \- Target of 75
phone pickups/day   \- Set up grayscale to kick in automatically at sunset
\- Result: 3.5 hrs/day, 77 pickups/day (30 hours gained)     **Week 4:**   \- 5
unblocks of social media per day   \- Morning and evening phone downtime (no
unblocking allowed)   \- Target of 50 phone pickups/day   \- Grayscale to kick
in automatically at sunset      \- Result: 2 hrs/day, 55 pickups/day (42 hours
gained)     The amount of time I've unlocked is staggering. For 2025, I'm going
to use the week 4 set up for my ongoing management. I feel like I'm not
constantly working from behind for the first time in a long time...

 What does “unblock” mean? 
 
     basically I keep certain apps blocked all the time... and then I have to ""unblock"" them more intentionally
    to use them instead of just being able to open them anytime up until I hit a daily limit. So it forces me
    to be much more intentional about any ""session"" I want on social media or reddit, and makes me think
    twice.

     Yeah, is this an Apple thing?



 Tbh I just un-installed the apps off my phone. Then I took a few days so that my
brain could register that it wasn't an option every time I grabbed it. After the
connection had been made ( or unmade , I guess) it gave me a sense of control
over it that I wasn't expecting??Now if I want to use it for whatever reason, I
have to download it again and put all my Info in and never agree to saving my
info... so after I'm done with it, I uninstall and if I feel like using it , I
have to go through the whole process again.   It's really helped me alot. It's
also reminded me how much I hate how the algorithm feeds me shit I don't want to
consume, no matter how I try and curate it. It will always feed you what it
wants in some way... and when I find myself mindlessly scrolling now, I rebound
really quick once I start seeing all the crap I didn't like in the first place
and it's an instant reminder to uninstall 
 


 Dopamine detox is not a thing that exists as well as dopamine depletion, easy
dopamine and so on. 
 
     100% agree, I deeply hate this ""terms"" have become popular    That being said, what OP is sharing does
    seem to be a good approach to handle an unhealthy amount of screen time, so kudos to that

     It’s a misnomer, but dopamine down regulation due to hyper stimulus is real

     [removed]

     OP is just cutting out wasting activities lol

     [deleted]

     We can call it whatever we want. Maybe dopamine redirection would be a better term, but this one caught on
    and that’s okay



 How much dopamine did you get from this post? 
 
     How much dopamine were you desiring with that response??

     Reading your comment is giving me some oxytocin, baby



 Interesting and thanks for sharing your strategy and stats. Can you share some
more on how it “changed your life”. Emotional changes? Energy? Feel the same but
got more done? 
 
     yeah good question... one of the biggest changes was I feel like I have more ""space"" in my day to day
    life. I don't feel like I'm in a constant state of elevated anxiety... I don't think I realized how much
    the phone time was contributing.  I definitely have more energy (part of that is also because it helps me
    sleep better when I'm not so wired up)  And I'm getting more done in a focused and productive way than
    before. One symptom of using my phone like I did was I always bounced around from task to task instead of
    going into deeper focus.       So the combination of more time, and better productivity when I am working
    on things nets out to a pretty big impact.



 Out of interest, how long were your social media unblocks for? 
 
     I set it so I could do 5, 10, or 15 mins for each unblock. I honestly usually used 10 mins



 My biggest problem is that when I have all that free time, what do I do with it?
Trying to be constantly productive (I work 40 hours a week plus have several pet
hobbies and creative endeavours and relationships to maintain) kinda makes my
brain feel overloaded.  So it’s either doomscrolling on Reddit/Instagram mostly,
or watching films or TV shows on OTT apps - to unwind.  Curious to know how you
dealt with this? 
 
     Healthy downtime for me is reading a book or practicing my watercolor painting.



 What app did you use to cause friction and time limit your access? 
 
     I use Roots. iPhone and Android don't offer much customization and friction natively. I tried settings
    limits with iOS in the past and always just ignored them.   I found it on reddit but I like that I can set
    up scroll replacements so it redirects me to the things I picked out each Sunday when apps get blocked,
    and it has monk mode blocking which adds extra friction. I'd basically do a scheduled monk mode downtime
    5-9am, and 6pm-midnight, and then use it to keep distracting apps blocked at all times other than the
    downtime.  If you search ""screen time"" on the App Store you can find apps that are much better than the
    native functionality if you want to get serious about adding friction and sticking to limits.

     What is friction in this context?

     I love ‘Stay Free’ on android for this.



 I don’t mean to be negative Nancy here, but I’d like to point out that is not
possible to detox (deplete) out brains of dopamine, if we did, we would have
Parkinson’s disease.   Fasting from things / activities that we like won’t
“reset” dopamine levels.   Dopamine detox is just the incorrect name given to a
form of CBT, you’re more likely to engage regularly in bad behaviors if they’re
pleasurable and capable of producing dopamine.   That said, cutting down or
limiting doom scrolling, social media, etc, is beneficial but it has nothing to
do with dopamine detox as that’s not biologically possible. 
 
     I think you're misunderstanding what people mean by dopamine detox. We aren't suggesting that we remove
    all dopamine from our brains, we are suggesting that we removed the overstimulation & negative dopamine
    feeding activities & addictive behaviours, to be replaced with more natural dopamine feeding activities
    such as walking in nature, conversations with loved ones, reading a book & so on.

     On January 2nd, The Diary of a CEO podcast released an episode all about how dopamine is related to
    everything we do and consume, including addictions such as social media, drugs and alcohol, etc.   The
    episode is called: “The Dopamine Expert: Doing This Once A Day Fixes Your Dopamine! What Alcohol Is Really
    Doing To Your Brain! Your Childhood Shapes Future Addictions!” - I highly recommend it to anyone who wants
    to understand the biology of how our phones are so addictive (hint: it has everything to do with dopamine
    levels in our brains!)  *my previous comment was automatically deleted, I accidentally included a link to
    the podcast.



 love how you mentioned being able to review the actual impact every sunday so
there is a noticeable ROI for what you are doing which in turn enforces the
behavior more. will definitely try out! 
 
     Thanks, the weekly review made it feel much more “real” for lack of a better word. Good luck!

Share your best techniques for managing phone screen-time,"Share your best techniques for managing phone screen-time

It seems like phone screen-time is a common culprit in this forum, so let’s help
each other out and share the techniques we’re currently implementing.  Here’s a
few techniques I’ve been using. Sometimes I’ll be on fire and use all of them,
other times I’ll just use a combination.  I’ll make sure my downtime settings on
my phone start 30mins before bed and ends 1.5hrs after I’ve woken up. I’ll allow
only notifications from emergency contacts so that when I turn off my morning
alarm I’ll skim through my notifs and see if anything needs an immediate
response. Then go about my morning routine entirely phone free.  Only allowing
myself leisurely access to my phone once I’ve completed my main to-do tasks for
that day.  Switching to long-form content, swapping out doom scrolling for a
film, episode, YT video. On the tougher days I’ll do this while keeping my hands
busy with things like drawings, stitching etc.  Using my laptop more often for
things like playing music through a speaker, scrolling the web etc. makes my use
more intentional and stops me constantly jumping between apps.  Deleting really
distracting apps and only reinstalling them in the evenings when everything’s
done for the day.  Setting a 20-30min timer before I start a ‘doom-scrolling
session’  Quickly intercepting with “3-2-1” and lobbing my phone to the other
end of the room when I’ve caught myself doom-scrolling.

 I just leave my phone in another room when I need focus. Out of sight = less
temptation. I also switched my screen to grayscale which kills the dopamine hit
fast. 
 
     Out of sight out of mind really works a treat. It’s only when I leave it in another room where I realise
    how often I carry it with me even if I’m not using it. I’ll be in the lounge and I’ll take it with me into
    the kitchen just to make a cuppa which takes 2 minutes ??   Grayscales a good one! I switched mine to a
    redlight screen to help ease myself into bedtime hours, adding grayscale would be perfect to stop the
    doomscrolling.    

     How do you do grayscale? I couldn’t find it on my phone.



 For me, big screens seem to cause - wtf should I work-play on tiny screenies?!?
allergy  Even my pocket planner has twice the ""screen size"" of my iphone. 
 


 literally just completely turning it off. Also trying to do a device-free day
once a week. 
 


 1. Whenever I have the urge to doomscroll reels, I pick up any of my three
journals. I can either draw, write, put stickers.   2. No screen time three
hours before bed. I read a book instead.    3. Enrolled myself in free online
courses so I have something to do to 'pass' the time.

Weekly limit on screen time? Not just daily.,"Weekly limit on screen time? Not just daily.

Does anyone know of an app to limit screen time that has a weekly limit and not
just each day. Some days I’m on it very little and others I would like to spend
more time on it. I would like to save up in the week for days with a lot of down
time. I’m afraid if it was everyday I would feel like I had to get my time in.
Like use or loose vacation.

 Opal does that. You can set weekly limits instead of daily. Been using it for
YouTube and it works better than daily caps. 
 
     I’ve got opal and can’t see anyway to do this. Can you explain please?



 Honestly, you probably don’t need an app for that. The best “limit” is learning
to be intentional with how you use your phone. Try setting your own weekly goal
and stick to it manually. Once you build the habit, you won’t need software to
control it for you. 
 
     That's literally one of a few things an app is best for.      It's hard to controll things you barely even
    think about, and an app does that for you. Cut my screen time in 2 then 4 in a matter of days with android
    digital care. You don't even need an app, just set a limit. So good. Why wouldnt you use an app?

"I understimulated my overstimulated brain for 10 days, and it was fun","I understimulated my overstimulated brain for 10 days, and it was fun

A couple of days back, I came across a yt video titled “understimulating my
overstimulated brain.” And it intrigued me.  The video talked about how we’re
always anxious and never bored anymore. Think about it, when was the last time
you were truly bored? Not the “ugh, this routine is dull” kind of bored, but the
“I have absolutely nothing to do” kind of bored.   For me, that was probably
when I was a kid. These days I’m always occupied. My brain is constantly
engaged, there’s always something to watch, something to listen to, something to
scroll through.  In the video, the creator took a 7-day challenge to get bored.
No internet. No devices. She even added an hour of an intentionally boring task
like reading the instruction manual of a washing machine, to take it up a notch.
So, I decided to do the same. Ofc, I couldn’t go completely off the grid
because, well, gotta pay bills. But I restricted whatever I could.   No social
media. No entertaining content. No music. No podcasts. No audiobooks.  What was
allowed? Work-related videos and articles. Books too (tho I didn’t read a single
page lol).  \----------------  Day 1: It was really hard. Like, really, really
hard. I felt empty, like something major was missing. I always had my meals with
a screen in front of me and suddenly, it wasn’t there. I always had something
playing in the background while doing boring tasks, well, now no more. Somehow,
there was so much silence, yet so much noise in my head.  Days 2 & 3: Still
tough. Still felt weird. My brain kept looking for something to fill the
silence.  Day 4: Started to get a hang of it. Maybe even started liking (or at
least accepting) the reality.  \----------------  Now, a couple of things
happened.   1. I got insanely productive at work. Because I had nothing to do
apart from my work, I was focused in a good way, not the overwhelming way. Got
better ideas. I worked at 3x the speed.  2. My sleep improved both in terms of
quantity and quality. I struggled with falling asleep and staying asleep. This
got so much better. I felt well rested after waking up.  3. I felt less anxious
and actually felt good about my achievements.   To give you an example, I
completed a project within 3 days. If I weren’t doing the challenge, it might
have taken me about 2 weeks to complete. I was so proud of myself. However, if I
were using social media, I might have seen someone doing something else,
something crazy and invalidating my own achievements.  4. My screen time went
from 9–12 hours a day down to 2–3 hours a day.  \----------------  The original
plan was 7 days, but I liked it so much that I extended it to 10.   Of course, I
can’t (and don’t want to) stay off the internet forever. It’s been about 2-3
weeks since the challenge, and here’s how I’ve reintroduced content with some
rules.   1. Social media only on my laptop > The interface sucks, so I naturally
spend less time there.  2. Fixed slots for watching content > Ideally no
multitasking. 2-3 hours max, either while crocheting or when I actually want to
watch something and not carrying my phone around while doing chores.  3. Still
no apps on my phone > The extra friction keeps me away from mindless scrolling.
The goal is to be more present with whatever I am doing.  Edit: I tried sharing
the link twice, but it got removed.   Video name: Understimulating my
overstimulated brain for a week by Michelle Gia

 Really interesting. I teach 11-16 year olds and the cognitive decline and
inability to focus is truly shocking. The ‘old ways’ of teaching no longer work
and there is no work flow state for me anymore - I’m always having to stop due
to someone checking a phone, not focusing on the task, not hearing instructions
etc. it’s been a huge change (I’ve been teaching 15 years) particularly the
current 11 year olds. 
 
     I’ve seen the same thing with my cousins. One is a 5 yo girl, and the other is a 6 yo boy (different
    families). The boy has had a phone in his hands since he was really young because his parents found it
    easier to just give him a screen instead of dealing with him. On the other hand, the girl isn’t allowed to
    watch TV for more than an hour a day.  And you can really see the difference in how they act. The girl is
    super smart for her age, she knows about current events, different sports, and sm recipes. She spends a
    lot of time with her parents, so she learns a lot just from being around them. And the boy is the complete
    opposite. He throws tantrums all the time, doesn’t talk to people properly, and is way behind his younger
    cousin in terms of knowledge and social skills. I know I shouldn’t be comparing kids like this but it’s so
    shocking.

     The social shift is crazy. When I was a kid (and even beyond my 'kid' years), giving a phone to your kid
    was seen as helicopter parenting.  Now everyone thinks they'll die if they don't have a phone glued
    somewhere on their person.  It's not unreasonable to have all the kids put their phones in a container and
    collect them after class.  Any 'emergency' excuses are emotional manipulation (in 99.99% of cases).

     Why not make the board your screens? Albeit im 26 but I would have appreciated slides with all the things
    you talked on there written down. As a person with adhd who literally cannot focus even on my passions,
    words really do come in one ear and out the other. Im always dragged from one distraction to the other



 This is great. I have unintentionally tried this when I went on a trip and was
wondering about the sudden sense of focus. This is probably it. Thanks for
sharing. I'm gonna try it from today. 
 


 Thanks for sharing. I've been thinking about doing something like this because
I've been feeling like my mind has been full, and this has been going on for
months now, so I thought about not having social media, but my mind kept telling
me it was going to be something bad.   I already deleted social media apps for
months last year, but for me the most difficult part is once you're finished
with the ""break period"" and want to go back to social media again. I don't know
how to do it so I don't fall into this mind-overwhelming feeling. 
 
     I felt the same! I constantly felt occupied and overwhelmed, didn’t have the mental bandwidth for
    anything. I saw the video at the right time. GLAD!  As of now, I don’t feel like going back on social
    media, partly because I’m afraid I might fall back into old patterns, and partly because I genuinely don’t
    find any value there. If I want to be entertained, I have better ways without feeling guilty, overwhelmed,
    or anxious.  My goal is to have the apps on my phone and still not use them (why does it feel like a crazy
    goal?) But I feel like I’m currently recovering, and throwing myself into the middle of triggers won’t
    help with healing. So, I think I’m going to avoid it. Also, I just feel GOOD without them. And I don’t
    feel like I’m missing out on anything (which is weird because I always used to feel that way)



 alright. i know what to do now. thank you OP. 
 


 Hello! I am very happy for your achievements, keep it up, I suppose you will
live alone, because living with a family or a partner is more complicated, you
have to focus on yourself, because in my case, I spend much less time with my
cell phone, but in other cases not. You have a lot of willpower and courage. I
truly congratulate you. May it go well and don't leave it. Cheer up and
greetings! 🫡😀 
 
     I live with my family but barely stepped out of my room. My mom was glad to see me roaming around lmao



 At some point in the past month i realized the root cause of 90% of my problems
is being overstimulated. I really should do something like this 
 


 Any dopamine withdrawal symptoms? 
 
     Yes, especially in the first three days, it was HELL.  The feeling of emptiness. I felt like something was
    missing. Despite finishing all my work and doing everything else, it felt like there was something I still
    needed to do (I was missing out on guilt, the guilt of not building an empire at the age of 17 :P). This
    hit me the most during meals and at night (wired to watching something in both scenarios).  There was
    silence, yet a lot of noise (my thoughts). I tend to overthink a lot, and media is the perfect way to
    escape my thoughts. I was forced to sit with them, and it wasn’t the best feeling.  The emptiness stopped
    bugging me, but it didn’t fully go away, even by day 10. Still, both things got better with time.



 Hi, can you please share the video link here with us? Thanks for this post 
 
     I shared the link and the automoderator removed my comment. Just look it up the exact same title on you
    YouTube.



 100% agree. I’ve never went this hardcore but removing TikTok and Instagram from
your phone is a major step already. I only have Reddit left on my phone and
while I still crave for the little dopamine kicks, Reddit is not remotely as
satisfying as Reels or TikTok’s and therefore I never spend more than 10min on
it. This alone improved my ability to stick to non-exiting tasks massively and
can be done by everyone. Social media really is the curse of humanity despite
all its benefits. Can’t imagine how bad it must be for people that are
cognitively challenged and aren’t able to proper self reflection. 
 


 This experiment is honestly fascinating. It’s wild how we’ve reached a point
where just sitting in silence without distractions feels uncomfortable. It’s
like our brains are wired to crave constant input, and the moment there’s
nothing, we instinctively reach for our phones or find something to fill the
void.  I’ve tried something similar, and at first, it felt strange, almost
unsettling. But after a while, there was this weird sense of clarity, like my
thoughts had more space to breathe. Did you notice a lasting change after the
ten days, or did the urge to seek stimulation creep back in? I wonder if doing
this regularly could help reset attention spans in the long run.

"Turning exercise into ""currency"" for screen time - would this make procrastination better or worse?","Turning exercise into ""currency"" for screen time - would this make procrastination better or worse?

I ve been thinking about how much time we waste on , and a weird idea came to
mind: what if exercise literally ""unlocked"" screen time?  Like:  1push-up = 2
minutes of Instagram    A short walk = more credits  On one hand, it feels like
gamifying healthy habits. On the other, it might just reinforce the idea that
social media is a ""reward"" (which could backfire).  Do you think this kind of
system would help people manage procrastination, or would it end up being
demotivating/pointless

 I like the idea! I sorta do something similar..I have to get certain things done
before I reward myself with doing something on my phone.. it doesn't matter if
someone calls me or texts me during my ""chores"".. they have to wait until I'm
done and reward myself with phone time. 
 


 Try it. If it works, it works. Worst case, it doesn't work and you try something
else. 
 


 I don’t see anything wrong with granting yourself a healthy 20 minutes of
screen-time after you’ve completed a workout or ticked off the main task on your
to-do list.   I kinda like the idea, but I think making it too direct like 1
push up = 2mins of screen-time could have adverse effects on the brain like you
mentioned - and that’s not including potential for over-use injuries.  
 


 Its a great idea! My GF uses the Achieve - Earn Your Screen Time app on iOS
which does this but I have android and really wants something similar! Let me
know if you make it 
 


 I find these methods are wonderful for creating habits, less productive for
maintaining them.  So get started with it, but dont get frustrated when you
start to bend the rules a bit.  If you get too attached and have a bad day where
you are stressed and struggle to follow, dont let it be all or nothing. 
 


 Ironically doing it the other way round is more effective, as you then become
more aware of your usage

What are some effective ways you shortened your screen time?,"What are some effective ways you shortened your screen time?

im literally glued to my screen everyday and so far I’ve tried these methods
(and obviously failed):  1. Deleted my most used apps 2. Setting up screen time
in apple settings 3. Preoccupying myself  It’s genuinely so hard for me to quit
since ive been in the cycle for so long but i must fix things before it gets way
worse. Maybe you can even try bullying me into feeling bad about myself until i
quit! Any tips on how you broke your bad habits are appreciated! Crazy or not!!

 First of all, I’d suggest when you delete most used apps, leave the most boring
one on your phone. For example, delete instagram and YouTube but leave something
more text oriented, like twitter or Reddit. Text oriented stuff tends to make a
lot less of a dopamine hit when you use them and it can make the progress much
easier. There is also an alternative way, a little less difficult but also less
progressful, which is trying to forward your attention from short form of
content to longer ones, for example movies or TV series.  Second of all, you
must find something else that gives you some kind of dopamine boost but is not
on your phone. That will give your nervous system a way to still get dopamine by
doing something but move your attention from being on screen all the time  And
finally, and this is true generally, not only for this case, do not bully
yourself when it gets hard or you fail, failing is just one step to success in
anything, it will happen. The more you bully yourself, the less you tend to
accept another lifestyle and change in even a positive way. I tried getting of
from social networks and quick dopamine addiction for a year until I started
seeing that it doesn’t consume a lot of my free time, which included both
deleting apps and installing them again, failing and trying again. Believe in
yourself, believe that you can live in a lifestyle that you want and eventually
this will become truth 
 
     But what if you're addicted to Reddit, but not YouTube?

     I think this is the way



 > you can even try bullying me into feeling bad about myself until i quit  I
will confess that when my patience is short with folks who can't stop looking at
their phones, I remind myself that they're essentially shooting themselves in
the footsies.  I remind myself that these are ""hard times"".  The world is
heading towards autocracy, protectionism with Climate Change Chaos disrupting
food supplies.  AI is cutting down the number of jobs available. Competition is
spiking.  So, really, why in the world should I even ""nudge"" online strangers to
be better competition?  Hell, apparently a LOT of them don't even know how
incredibly useful just carrying a pocket notebook and pen is. 
 


 Use browser with no signed in accounts The recommended posts are meh so I'm not
distracted. Youtube gives me blank pages. 
 


 Change phone to black and white. Becomes much less interesting to look at
regardless of the app. 
 
     Greyscale (settings - colour filters - greyscale)



 bought an e reader and gave myself reasonable screentime limits on my phone
locked behind a password only someone else knows. I plan on cutting it even
shorter in a few weeks. 
 


 You unplug, touch grass, and talk to others as if there were no technology.  I
faced the same issue before, glued to my phone and laptop the moment I woke up.
All of my devices only rest when I rest. But when you shift to conventional
methods, that's when you will realize everything is just distractions.  Not
saying technology or any productivity method or apps are not good. Start with
the basics and use those tools (methods or apps) to adapt to technology while
keeping your screen time to a minimum.  Since I have been going to my businesses
physically, the drive time, car or bike, is enough (2-3 hours) to detox me while
still having technology to help me navigate on the shortest route possible. 
 


 I have set up timers for all social media apps. 10 minutes per day for each app.
App automatically gets paused for the rest of the day once the time is over. 
 


 The only thing that worked for me was creating friction before I could open my
time wasting apps. I moved them into a hidden folder on a separate screen,
removed all shortcuts, and logged out each time. The extra 15 seconds to log in
was just enough to make me think “do I really want to do this?” and most of the
time I didn’t. 
 


 Read Digital Minimalism. Very good book 
 


 try opal, adds friction and limits to apps and websites

How to really control screen time,"How to really control screen time

I generally use Apple’s built in Screen Time feature to limit how much doom
scrolling I do in any given day, but honestly, it s way too easy to just push
the “15 minutes more” or “ignore limit for today” buttons. Does anyone have a
better solution for controlling your time spent mindlessly on screens?

 I mostly use my phone at night, but I don’t charge it anymore. When it dies in
30 minutes, I just sleep instead of waiting for it to charge. 
 


 Set a password. 
 
     Only if someone else sets the password. As long as I know it, I’ll imply override myself at any time.

"""You should reduce your screen time...""","""You should reduce your screen time...""

I normally like [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQqdmDjgx9k)
videos, and the following is obviously an exageration, but it somewhat
illustrates something that I usually find extremely frustrating when people just
puts together loose pieces of advice without thoroughly considering how they
interact together as a system...  Step 1: Stop using your computer and telephone
Me: Ok! Done  Step 2: Organize your workspace   Me: Mmm, ok, most of that is
computer documents and such, so...  Step 3: Review your habit tracking systems
Me: But wait, this is on my phone! How am I supposed to...?  Step 4: Do some
journaling   Me: Dude, wait, I've been trying to reduce paper use, I keep word
documents...!  Step 4: Read a book   Me: (having all digital books) FUUUUUUUUUUU
(╯°□°)╯ ︵   ┻━┻

 Maybe it's best drawing a hard line at different apps instead of screens
altogether. Like if YouTube is your top used app or site instead of Word you
know you're spending screen time there not being productive, and cutting that
out will actually reduce your net screen time, yknow. I get that it might be
easier drawing a hard line further away from temptation, but anyway... 
 
     Precisely. I've got an app called Cold Turkey which blocks the unproductive websites during the day.

     Yeah, it's true that the title can be more generic, but when given in the context of ""sleep hygiene"" I
    think it usually means no screens at all prior to sleep.



 Digital Minimalism has a much better take on all this. Use technology to benefit
you, and take a good stock on what is important vs harmful / distracting. (I
relapsed bad into the harmful side oops) 
 
     Do you have any good source for this? I've tried incorporating a bit of ""physical"" minimalism in my life,
    and I also frequently searching for ways to organize my digital stuff. Maybe this could help with that 🤔.



 I think that the idea of ""screen time"" is one of the least-useful phrases in
modern discourse, precisely because it doesn't differentiate.  I see parents
talking about their kid's ""screen time"", and using that phrase referring to
everything from ""playing Candy Crush"" to ""reading a book on their Kindle"". The
first of those things might be reasonable to restrict. The second doesn't make
sense to restrict (IMHO) unless the kid is turning into an absolute couch
potato.  But unless you're talking about sleep cycles and light temperatures'
effect on your ability to rest, ""screen"" isn't monolithic.  I'd say that the
ultimate goal is to consider the *actual problems* one is facing. If you use
your phone for productivity software, that's cool. But if the productivity
software being on your phone makes you want to check Facebook because the phone
is out, *that's* the problem - not the fact that you're using your phone.  Even
Cal Newport allows for device use during a ""digital minimalism"" sabbatical - but
you have to be using it for stuff that's critical to your life and livelihood. 
 


 Can't remember which Thomas Frank video but in one of them, he suggests to turn
the Internet off.  Can you do all the things you mentioned without using the
Internet? 
 


 I feel ya. At least with the e-books it's on a kindle, which pretty much cannot
do anything else x) 
 


 For me, reducing screen time is cutting back on non-productive apps that do not
help me in any way. Such as social media, gaming, mindlessly scrolling YouTube,
etc. Digital books and journaling are completely fine to me when it comes to
screen time. Let’s call it, productive screen time 
 


 I reduced my screen time from 5 hrs to 2 hrs. Idk how but I did. Mostly I
uninstalled unnecessary apps as well as social media. Lol that's it. 
 


 Precisely. And one thing productivity ""gurus"" seem to never talk about? How to
productively use all this advice/tips, tricks, etc. they are pushing out. This
is why you have to know what works for \*you\* and then run every piece of
advice/tips/etc. through self-identified qualifiers you create based on your
preferences and needs.     None of this is one-size-fits-all. No one person's
advice can be followed to the ""t"" \*\*especially\*\* not when they are content
creators. I mean think about it... their job isn't to create a streamlined
system -- it's to continuously pump out content that gets clicks, shares, views,
likes, etc. And that means following the trends, catering to what people want to
\*\*hear\*\* and not necessarily what they \*\*need\*\*.      This is why I
stick to a mixture of the bullet journaling, getting things done, and scrum
philosophies as my ""core foundation"". Flexibility, experimentation, and
continuous tweaks/edits to the system are critical. Productivity systems can't
be static or set in stone because that's just not human nature. Our lives are a
constant flux of changing situations/scenarios/life phases. The system you use
needs to work WITH your brain. You can't force your brain to work with the
system. It won't stick. You'll burn out. It will be inefficient and miserable.
I've been reading through Tiago Forte's book Design Your Work (it's on Kindle
Unlimited!) and it has made so much of this really click into place for me on an
intellectual level - if that make sense. I've been working a personalized,
flexible system for years - but this book has made it click as to WHY it's so
important and WHY static, set-in-stone systems always ""fail"" for me (and well,
everyone ...except maybe super Type-A's). 
 
     >I've been reading through Tiago Forte's book Design Your Work (it's on Kindle Unlimited!) and it has made
    so much of this really click into place for me on an intellectual level - if that make sense.  I think
    most of us are trying to mix and match the different pieces of advice we find in these forums to make our
    own system. It might be interesting to see if this guy talks about a more methodical way to do this!



 You need to create your productivity life. Everyone's style is different. Some
points are the same  * Social media consumes you, delete it or limit it by 1
hour max (unless work) * Games and their notifications / in app purchases /
stories consumes you. Try to minimize or delete them. * Video stream services
like YouTube / Netflix / Hulu etc. takes so much time to hang out. Minimize
YouTube  time, try to look at Netflix only 1-2 hours a day.  For my
Productivity: I use Apple ecosystem mainly with its apps excluding Reminders (I
use Things). They are seamless integrated across my iPad, iPhone and Mac. I use
Notes to journaling(with Apple Pencil) / taking digital notes / receipts / quick
access notes and Save it later for urls with their respectfull folders.  I use
Books app for book reading, better than carrying physical books.  I use Mail to
handle mails. I use Apple Mail with a business Office 365 mail and personal
icloud mail. I only archive or delete a mail. Nothing more fancy there. (I can
search every mail by details so I don't use folders)  I use Apple Calendar and
it is enough for my needs. I try to use time block but usually I rearrange
events during the day  I use Files app with iCloud for personal and OneDrive for
work  ------------------  The point is that this system works for me better than
others ( I left using Google apps for work) , but that doesn't mean it will be
same with you. Maybe you use Android and you will find more useful to use
Samsung Ecosystem or Google's one. You need to try and see which tool you will
use more likely. 
 


 Cut out the excess. You know what you’re indulging in online, so simply delete
it and remove the distraction and BAM you don’t gotta listen to what these
alleged “productivity guru’s” be spittin, find what works for YOU not some rich
you tuber . Those videos are for money anyways, just small tips n shit, they
think one size fits all. Wrong, just do what works for you and remove what
doesn’t work for you, and SEE the progress instead of debating about this
alleged progress like it’s something outside of yourself :)

"I sunk hundreds of hours into trying out the different screen time solutions, here are my top 5","I sunk hundreds of hours into trying out the different screen time solutions, here are my top 5

Managing screen time is something I’ve been actively working on, and other
solutions such as physically removing the smartphone or turning the screen into
greyscale didn't end up working for me, for various reasons. I ended up sinking
a lot of time into testing out a bunch of screen time apps so I figured this
could be helpful for others out there. Here's my honest review of the top 5
screen time management apps I tested, including what I loved and what I didn’t.
Disclaimer: I have an Iphone so sorry android users out there  **1. Apple Screen
Time (Built-In)**  Apple’s native Screen Time feature is a solid option if
you’re in the Apple ecosystem. It tracks your app usage, lets you set limits,
and even includes downtime scheduling. I liked having it built right into my
iPhone.  **What I Liked:**  * Super convenient—no downloads required. * Detailed
reports about where my time was going. * Easy to set app-specific limits and
downtime.  **What I Didn’t Like:**  * Limited flexibility; once you hit a limit,
it’s too easy to bypass it. * The family controls feel a bit clunky compared to
dedicated apps.  **2. Achieve! Earn Your Screen Time**  This app is perfect for
anyone who struggles with motivation or wants to gamify their productivity.
Achieve! locks distractions on your phone and makes you ""earn"" screen time by
completing real-life goals. This one takes a unique spin on things and reframes
screen time from being something bad that the app must block, and instead you
""unlock"" it after being productive and completing your goals. I liked how it
both limited my screen time and increased my productivity at the same time.
**What I Liked:**  * The reward system made me *want* to finish my goals. * It’s
easy to customize goals, whether they're about work, fitness, or personal
growth. * The app feels empowering instead of restrictive.  **What I Didn’t
Like:**  * It doesn’t yet integrate with popular task apps like Todoist or
Notion.  **3. Forest**  Forest is as simple as it is clever. You plant a virtual
tree whenever you want to focus, and it grows as long as you stay off your
phone. If you exit the app, your tree dies. It’s great for anyone who needs a
visual reminder to stay on task.  **What I Liked:**  * The concept of “growing a
forest” over time made me feel accomplished. * It’s incredibly easy to use and
aesthetically pleasing. * Bonus: They plant real trees with your points!  **What
I Didn’t Like:**  * It’s not as effective for managing screen time in the long
term—more of a short-term focus tool.  **4. Freedom**  Freedom is designed for
serious distraction blockers. It lets you create custom schedules to block apps,
websites, or even the entire internet across all your devices. I tested it
during a work week and found it incredibly effective. This one works great for
anyone who is looking to completely shut down screen time in their life.  **What
I Liked:**  * The cross-platform blocking is seamless. * It’s highly
customizable—you can block specific websites or app categories. * It has a
“locked mode” to prevent changes while the block is active.  **What I Didn’t
Like:**  * Setup can feel overwhelming at first with all the options. * The
price is on the higher side for premium features.  **5. Opal**  Opal is an iOS-
exclusive app that helps you focus by blocking distracting apps and websites.
It’s designed to keep you mindful of your habits while offering a clean, modern
interface. I gave it a spin during a busy work week and appreciated its polished
approach to productivity.  **What I Liked:**  * The ""Focus Sessions"" feature
lets you set intentions and stay on track. * Real-time notifications remind you
to stay focused when you’re about to drift. * The integration with Apple’s Focus
Modes is seamless, making it feel native to iOS.  **What I Didn’t Like:**  *
Some features, like advanced scheduling, are locked behind a subscription. * It
lacks the gamification or rewards that some other apps offer.  #

 Wonderful!  Thank you!  I also like „Stay focused“, because it makes me spend a
minute journaling and a to do my daily Duolingo, before it lets me open YouTube
(or whatever App you would define). I really like it. 
 
     I didn't try that one but I really like the feature of ""get your shit done first, then screen time"". I
    think it works a lot better than just full on blocking everything



 *Spends hundreds of hours of screen time in an attempt to reduce screen time*
Productivity genius over here. 
 


 And you're winner is? 
 
     The one that has stuck for me is the Achieve! app. I personally need a kick in the butt to get my shit
    done and since im also a gamer being able to play wild rift with my friends is enough motivation for me to
    knock out my todo list for the day asap



 any recommendations similar to Achieve! but for a pc?  I find that I spend a lot
of time on the same time-wasting apps (YouTube, Twitter, Insta, etc.) on my
computer if they're blocked on my phone 
 


 I got excited about your screen solution until you ruled out android. Back to
hundreds of hours looking. 
 


 I really credit Opal with changing my life! It’s impossible to uninstall/disable
and the pro subscription lets you customise blocks and locks!  use my referral
code “CF6HV” for a 1 month free guest pass

people in my shoes some time.  # 1. Achieve! Earn Your Screen Time  This app
caught my attention because it’s so different from other screen time tools.
Instead of just blocking apps or limiting usage, Achieve! motivates you to
complete real-life goals to unlock your screen time. It felt more like a
productivity game than a restriction tool, which made it surprisingly fun to
use.  **What I Loved:**  * The idea of “earning” my screen time gave me a sense
of accomplishment. * Setting custom goals was super easy, and it felt great to
hit them. * Free to use forever  **What I Didn’t Love:**  * I really wish it
could integrate with task management apps like Todoist or Notion.  This app
turned my daily goals into a challenge I wanted to win, and it’s now one of my
go-to tools for staying productive.  # 2. Apple Screen Time  Apple’s built-in
Screen Time feature was the easiest to start using because it’s already on my

integrated with my iPhone. * The detailed breakdown of my screen time helped me
see where I was wasting time. * Setting app limits and downtime schedules was
straightforward.  **What I Didn’t Love:**  * It’s way too easy to override app
limits with a simple tap. * The family sharing features feel clunky compared to
dedicated apps.  If you’re in the Apple ecosystem and just need basic tracking
and limits, Screen Time is a solid choice.  # 3. Forest  I had heard about
Forest for a while and finally gave it a try. The concept is simple but
brilliant: plant a virtual tree whenever you need to focus, and it grows as long
as you stay off your phone. If you give in to temptation, your tree dies—talk
about guilt trips!  **What I Loved:**  * Watching my forest grow over time was
unexpectedly rewarding. * The app is beautifully designed and really easy to
use. * They plant real trees with your points, which makes it feel meaningful.
**What I Didn’t Love:**  * It’s more of a short-term focus tool than a full
screen time management solution.  This app is fantastic if you want to build
short bursts of focus into your day. Plus, who doesn’t want to grow a virtual
(and real) forest?  # 4. Freedom  Freedom is the app I turned to when I needed
hardcore distraction blocking. It’s not just for your phone—it works across all

incredibly effective at keeping me on task.  **What I Loved:**  * I could block
specific websites, apps, or even the entire internet if I wanted to. * The
cross-device integration was seamless. * “Locked mode” made sure I couldn’t
change my mind mid-session (a blessing and a curse).  **What I Didn’t Love:**  *
The setup process felt overwhelming. * It’s one of the pricier options if you
want all the premium features.  Freedom is perfect if you need a no-excuses
solution to distractions. It’s a bit intense, but sometimes that’s exactly what
you need.  # 5. Opal  I stumbled across Opal while looking for an iOS-specific
app, and I’m glad I did. The app focuses on mindfulness and intentionality,
which made it feel less restrictive and more like a productivity partner.
**What I Loved:**  * The “Focus Sessions” feature is genius—it asks you to set
an intention before starting, which kept me on track. * It integrates with
Apple’s Focus Modes, which made it feel native to my iPhone. * Real-time
notifications reminded me to stay on task when I got tempted.  **What I Didn’t
Love:**  * Some of the more advanced features, like scheduling, require a
subscription. * There’s no gamification or rewards, which might appeal to some
users.  For now Im continuing to use the Achieve! app since it does what I

 you should try Steppin, it's new and its the only app i've found that actually
ties screen time to physical activity. i.e. you have to walk before you can
'unlock' your apps. I'm loving it so far 
 


 Great breakdown! Achieve! sounds like a fun and unique way to stay productive.
I’ve used Forest before, and the guilt of killing a tree definitely kept me off
my phone! Might have to check out Freedom for more hardcore blocking.

How to hard block your screen time on iPhone?,"How to hard block your screen time on iPhone?

Hi guys I’m looking for something comparable to [cold Turkey for
PC](https://getcoldturkey.com) or [stay focused for Android](https://play.google
.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en_US&gl=US) on iPhone.  An app
that will let me set parental controls on myself without letting me disable it
on a whim.  Ideas?  I tried screen time but setting my own password is stupid 😑

 So I've been playing around with building an app like this. It's a bit of an
evolution behind an existing app I built which is an alarm clock app that
charges you money for staying in bed. Won't link to it as it's not relevant.
The idea for this new app is that you have to keep it open for a certain period
of time (you set it) or pay a penalty if you leave the app.  Interested? 
 
     I think setting a penalty is possibly the only way to do this. Basically I am unable to put my phone away,
    but if there were a way to lock it and forget it I would <3 the app.  I'm a product manager btw - feel
    free to dm me if you want to chat.

     [deleted]

     I appreciate the idea, but honestly I think hard-locking apps is more straight forward. For example [what
    this app does](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stayfocused&hl=en_US&gl=US). The thing is
    some parts of iPhone are genuinely useful, but just about an equal amount of parts of genuinely
    addictive/toxic.  Maybe even an app that just sets the password for screen time then doesn't reveal it for
    a set period of time would be super-simple and awesome. Personally I'd buy it even if pricey.



 Freshman year of college, 2017, I was broke as hell and broke my phone, didn’t
get another for 3-4 months, and this was the only thing that has ever worked for
me LMAO. It was freeing though. I was soooo productive, in flow, and happy. Want
to get rid of mine all together at some point again and just utilize the same
tools on my pc 
 
     >freedom  This I find interesting and honestly am considering it... I just need to consider what the vital
    functions are that are worth preserving.  How did you contact your friends? How did you use Uber if
    needed? Etc... I'm honestly quite interested in this, but I'm just trying to make sure it is practical.



 I use an app called forest! It’s 1.99 I think in the App Store (one time price)
and it’s based on the pomodoro method. You can set it for up to 2hours, it locks
your phone to the app. As the time goes down, trees grow in your “forest” and if
you leave the app before the time goes down, the trees you would have grown die.
And you see dead trees in your forest. Also you earn coins so you can buy
certain things.   When I use it, it helps because the thought of having those
dead trees in my forest drives me nuts. 
 
     +1 for Forest. Its not only the negative reinforcement from the thought of the little trees dying that
    keeps me from stopping the app, but also the positive reinforcement from collecting coins with every plant
    that can then be used to buy new types trees. I like to color coordinate my forests for extra
    satisfaction. There’s also a Forest chrome extension too.

     But won’t this cause me to just be on the app all day? I’m confused

 Your best bet might be a lockbox with a timer, like in The Social Dilemma. 
 
     Agreed, this is the only thing that works for me.  Easy and effective.    There are cheaper options
    available but this lockbox was only $40 when I purchased several years ago.

 Downgrade to a flip phone and keep your other devices at home. It will at least
keep you connected in the moment while out of the house and help drive that as a
normal state of being. 
 
     Haha this is probably a good option.



 Looks like iOS has Stay Focused [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stay-focused-
self-control/id1367887988](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stay-focused-self-
control/id1367887988).      Also something called freedom

distractions/id1269788228](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freedom-block-
distractions/id1269788228).      You could probably also rig some sort of Siri
shortcut to do this for you, if you want to make something custom 
 
     I tried their 'stay-focused' already it isn't the same as the android one... It doesn't let you lock it
    for a fixed period of time (you can just turn it off at any time after timer is set).   I couldn't get
    freedom to work personally, but maybe I didn't try enough.

     I use Freedom. It doesn’t work great on iPhone but it’s excellent on PC.



 I doubt this is possible.  There are a fair amount of boundaries set up for iOS
and I don't see how it would even be remotely possible other than something
apple implements themselves.

I am currently struggling with cell phone addiction, i spend around 9-10 hours a
day mindlessly scrolling on social media. Now i want to focus more on studies,
organizing and hobbies like drawing but i don’t have the motivation because my
dopamine intake has been destroyed by social media. Do you know some app that
helps to limit screen time (i tried the screen time limit configuration from
apple and it’s honestly awful).

 My suggestion will be BLOCK it has a green white logo with lock in it, the
customisation it offers is great, hourly limit, launch limit, screen limit,
different profiles for different apps, hands down the best app there, and the
best IT GIVES U QUOTES ON TIME. which atleast helped me a lot

I downloaded the [Moment app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moment-screen-
time-tracker/id771541926?mt=8) and used the free version to simply track how
much I was on my phone just to see if I could reduce my screen time by gamifying
it for myself.   I really had no idea how many minutes a day I was on my phone,
but I knew it was too many (especially social media) and that I could get a lot
more done (books read, studying done) if I could reduce my screen time. I let
the app run for a week before looking and holy mother was I appalled and
disgusted with myself when I actually saw how many minutes. Simply seeing that
made me cut back dramatically and so far it's stuck. I was at 6hours at day
before I started looking and right now I'm consistently under 2 hours a day and
I think I can get to below 1.5h. (Note that some of my job involves Instagram
and editing images on the phone, so that accounts for some of the time that I
won't be able to cut, which is fine).  Screengrabs of before and after:
http://imgur.com/a/3Gsks (note that the really bad day was when I was on an
airplane for 6 hours).  Edit: there are in-app purchases that supposedly can
help as well, like coaching and hard limits such, but I've only used the free
version of the app to achieve this and don't plan on upgrading.

 Great tip! I couldn't find Moment for Android so I downloaded something called
Quality Time which seems similar. I spend way too much time on Reddit, so this
will be good for me! I use Forest for times when I want to block myself on my
phone or web browser, but this fills a different need. 
 
     Hope it works!

Reducing Screen Time,"Reducing Screen Time

Hi everyone,   I've been reducing my technology use and tracking my screen time
for a few months for being more productive. I use Apple's own screen time
tracker for iPhone and Forest app. But as the days went by my need for a screen
time tracker for my computer increased. So if you have any Chrome Extension
recommendations please do share with me, I would be grateful.

 Forest has a chrome extension but from the reviews it doesn’t seem as useful
(doesn’t offer pausing or cancelling a session midway), the focus to-do pomodoro
timer might be a better one 
 
     thanks!

Screen Time in iOS 12,"Screen Time in iOS 12

I’m honestly very happy that Apple decided to include statistics about our
screen time on our phones and iPads because it really helps put your life in
perspective.   For those who don’t know, the new iOS 12 has a feature called
Screen Time that basically provides statistics on the amount of hours you’ve
spent on your phone, what sort of apps you’ve used and for how long, the amount
of times you’ve picked your phone up in an hour (every hour of the day) and also
the number of notifications you’ve got in total and per app. It also gives you a
summary every week on your average screen time and most used apps and such.
Most of us (myself included) spend mindless hours upon hours on end staring at
our phones, only to contemplate where all our times is going, and how 24 hours
don’t feel like much anymore. I found this feature extremely useful in the
basics of helping me understand how much time I dedicate to certain forms of
entertainment or socialization, and honestly it really helps me control myself
and self-reflect on where I want to allocate my time throughout the day and week
so I can make the most out of being productive and efficient.  Other interesting
features include “DownTime”, “App Limits”, and even “Screen Time for Family”
which I would gladly discuss in another post sometime in the future.  Thanks for
reading, Cheers!"
"Working in front of a screen for long time affects your productivity, here is a simple solution I made","Working in front of a screen for long time affects your productivity, here is a simple solution I made

Hey /r/productivity,  My job requires me to be in front of a bright screen all
the time. So I was suffering from Eye strain and it dragged my productivity down
quite a bit. My doctor suggesting following 20-20-20 rule, i.e., look at least
20 feet away every 20 minutes for at least 20 seconds. I tried to do it but
keeping track of time was difficult. So I wrote a basic app that takes care of
this. Since it is already made I thought I will share it with the world. It is a
simple app without any other feature so don't judge me, but it works just fine.
Only for iOS right now, but I have been asked by a lot of friends and family
members to write it for Android so I will do that probably next month.  Here is
a link:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eye-care-20-20-20/id967901219?mt=8

"Can’t leave my phone alone, help!","Can’t leave my phone alone, help!

Hi, 36 year old FTM/SAHM here. I’m really struggling with phone addiction atm,
my screen time is anywhere between 6-10 hours a day and I’m at the end of my
tether and can’t seem to stop. It’s really just taking over my life which sounds
dramatic but it’s true. I’ve tried several things previously and none of them
stick.   I’ve read the book ‘how to break up with your phone’ (lasted about 2
weeks then habits crept back in), I’ve tried screen time limits, I’ve tried
brick, I’ve tried greyscale/dumbing down my phone/ I’ve tried various apps.
These solutions never stick and I end up back in bad habits.   I feel like there
was me before phone addiction - someone who was happy, excited for life, then me
post phone addiction, struggling with low mood, low motivation and struggle to
focus and be productive.   My biggest problems are instagram/FB reels, I try
deleting the apps but end up just downloading them again when I’m bored. I feel
like I’m not as present as I should be with my baby and my house is always a
mess and I’m forever agitated and overwhelmed because nothing ever gets done,
and I blame it on the fact ‘im a busy mum’ but the reality is I spend too much
time doom scrolling over tasks around the house. Even when I delete the apps, I
find myself just picking up my phone and opening my email or looking at news
websites/pinterest.   I’ve thought about buying a dumb phone but the reality is
I need a smart phone. Theres too many things in this modern day where its just
practical to have a smart phone (eg apple pay/maps/wallet/ticket QR
codes/whatsapp etc etc) has anybody been in my situation and turned it around?
Advice needed.

 No solution- but I hear you. I am struggling as well. With the same feeling that
I wish I could get rid of it entirely but realistically that's just not
happening. It feels like such a personal failure as well, packed with guilt and
shame. 
 
     I feel the same.



 I can empathise. I use an old iPhone 8 for social media - the processing is slow
so I get fed up after a few minutes of scrolling (doesnt stop me entirely
though). I also have two phones now, one for social media and one for day to day
life which has the basic apps - like WhatsApp/maps etc.   Quite frankly, above
all I just needed something else to do. On the days where I was socially busy,
whether that be lunch with friends, going to the gym, cooking etc, I spent
significantly less time than on days where I was just at home. I know as a SAHM
you're likely with your kid(s) at home most of the day - but you will NEED to
find something else to fill the time - cook, read, call a friend, SOMETHING to
REPLACE scrolling time. A new hobby? Learn a new language? 
 
     the slow processing really helps things, i avoid sitting in fast wifi rooms



 As someone who had 6-7 hours of iPhone screen time per day in 2024, I have
worked my way down to 3-4 hours as of this week. I am hoping to continue to cut
down on that time to get myself closer to 2 hours.  Here's a few things I'd
recommend:  1. Put your phone (on ring for specific people) in a drawer in the
farthest room from where you usually spend your time. Sometimes simply having it
out of sight can cut down on scrolling. 2. Turn off most notifications so you
don't get drawn in by the screen turning on. 3. Do not have social media apps on
your phone at all. None. Zero. Zilch. Once you reintroduce one, they all come
flooding back in.  \#3 has been the biggest help for me. It is insanely
difficult but do not allow yourself to have those apps on your phone. When you
go to download them again, have a mantra like ""I am using my phone as an escape""
or ""The post-scrolling crash is not worth it."" You need to parent yourself a bit
--and it does get easier. I only allow myself to go on social media on my
computer or iPad, and it is simply less fun and addictive to watch reels/stories
on those screens vs. my phone.  If that doesn't help, look into a Brick (people
have had mixed success) or one of those timed lock boxes. You need to build up
some friction and resistance and scrolling a bit harder. 
 
     Thanks, I think i’m hoping for a magic hack but the reality is I need to do this myself and show some self
    discipline. I think I’ll work on cutting it i. Half first like you have and then go from there. I will def
    try these tips.



 1)  Do you have family or friends who will hold you accountable?  Make sure you
aren't spending too much time on you phone?  2)  Do you know why small screens
are so addicting?  The science behind it? 
 
     I could ask my husband, problem is I’m home alone mon-fri whilst he works. So its very easy for me to sit
    and scroll as i’m alone with my baby so much.  Not exactly, but I know a little about dopamine addiction.



 Maybe you should try to take this slow and just try to leave phone for 5 mins a
time. I’m also struggling with this, the crucial part is not doomscrolling
constantly. Try to watch long videos and run away from short content. It is okay
you consume it sometimes. But take it slow, just try to not do it 5-10 min a
day. And don’t hate yourself, thousands of genius people worked on these to hack
our dopamine system for longer screen times. 
 
     Good tip! Its the reels and shorts that get you! will try to avoid, if there a way to turn off shorts and
    reels within an app?



 You need an alternative for what to do when you’d otherwise reach for your
phone! Maybe a kindle to read books? Maybe a cross word puzzle? Maybe chicklit
novels from the library? Maybe audiobooks or podcasts? Making a nice cup of tea
for a tea break? Music? Coloring book? Fidget toys or playdoh?   Otherwise
you’re just trying to go from hours of dopamine addiction to raw dogging life
and that’s incredibly difficult 
 
     Agreed! My kindle is currenty on charge and I’m planning my next read, thank you



 Well I know this probably wont help... but I didnt just delete the fb and insta
apps. I deleted my accounts. I only use reddit, pinterest, and discord on my
phone now. You sound like you need a new hobby though too. Something to keep you
too busy to pick up your phone. Gardening, baking, painting, woodworking,
glassblowing, pottery, beading, crocheting, hiking... maybe a class somewhere to
make new friends and do stuff with them. Hiking, camping, ren faire...   Im a
SAHM too but I run a dog grooming business from my garage and I garden and make
sourdough bread. Plus ive been camping going to ren faire with friends recently,
theres another coming up in july im going to too. I also talk on voice chat to
my bff everyday like we are a podcast.   Anyone in comments feel free to add
hobby suggestions!! 
 


 Just to add, I feel it’s also making me a shit mum, wife and homemaker, tbf I
wouldnt blame my husband if he left me. The house is never tidy, our laundry is
never up to date, I never make nice meals for him, or organise any fun family
trips and never put any effort into my appearance anymore. I just feel like a
failure as a person.  Also the fact I spend so much time alone all day doesnt
help, the temptation to scroll is always there. 
 
     Find podcasts and or YouTube videos on topics that interest you such as what you gravitate to when
    scrolling and play that with AirPods or something to keep you stimulated while you try and navigate the
    daily household activities. (Also been a sahm of a now 4yo and this is how I survived the early days)

     Is there any possibility you might be experiencing postnatal depression? Lack of motivation is sometimes a
    symptom.   Is there anyone you can ask over to keep you company while you do housework, even a high school
    kid who could play with the baby for an hour while you do only as much as you can do in an hour? If I have
    someone, even for a short time, the embarrassment of not working in front of them helps!

     This right here is where we find the buried lede.   ""Ask not why the addiction, but why the pain?""
    Basically, start by asking what your addiction is doing for you? Feeling like a failure to the point where
    you worry about your husband leaving you is some pretty big stuff. One of the reasons why the phone is so
    compelling is because it helps soothe those feelings in the short term - even if it exacerbates it in the
    long term.  Also, you're fighting sophisticated technology built by billion dollar companies - so maybe
    afford yourself some slack. You never stood a chance ;)   I agree with other posters: the road out might
    look like reclaiming some sense of agency and purpose. Shaming yourself for using your phone is going to
    lead to more phone usage. Instead, if you can focus on the good feeling you get from doing something
    challenging but meaningful, it's easier to break the cycle.   But also, might require some vulnerable
    conversations with your husband about where you're at to find more support, and maybe even therapy if you
    can afford it...



 Can you join any baby/mom classes, activities? People will maybe understand and
you could meet up during the day when husband works. Don’t be too hard on
yourself! 
 
     I def need to get out more and meet other mums. Maybe a weekly timetable of activities will help. Thanks

Happy New Year everyone!  On Dec 30th I've released my first app. I wanted to do
it for a few years and I finally did it!  I'm posting it here because I'm
excited and I really think **it might help you with new year resolutions**.  In
general, it looks like any other to-do app you know, but it has a feature of
creating dynamic, auto-scheduled habits. You can create some tasks like 'read a
book 3 times a week' and the app will automatically try to find the best days
for it (eg. ones where you're not really busy and you have not so many events in
your calendar) and automatically schedule it.  It also has daily tasks
suggestions feature. When you open 'today' screen, besides normal, planned to-
do's, you can see task suggestions. It might show you tasks you haven't checked
in a while, or ones that are frequently snoozed, etc.  I hope I'll not make
anyone angry promoting my app. Indeed it is the goal of this post, but I also
really think it might be helpful for many of you.  App Link:

     It does, but they're working now for non-repeating tasks. I'll add support for repeating task
    notifications tomorrow and send it to the app store!  &#x200B;  Thanks! Let me know with any feedback you
    have! feel free to pm me with anything :) I'd really appreciate it and try to implement missing features
    asap.

     ps. if you like it, I'd really appreciate app store rating :)

8 Desk items helped me to boost productivity,"8 Desk items helped me to boost productivity

1. Noise cancellation Headphones =============================== These
headphones will help you indulge in your work leaving all the sound distractions
away. If you like silence with some good background music, subscribe to any
music streaming service and play some calm music like Jazz or something. I use
“pure focus” playlist from Apple music.  2. Blue Light Filter Glasses
=============================== Such glasses eliminate blue light from your
screens. They help you to avoid headaches, dry eyes etc. And it is proven that
blue lights from the electronic device screens can cause sleep problems. These
glasses are very much available in any optical center and are also available
with power glasses.  3. Plants =============================== Having a nature’s
touch on your workspace improves the aesthetics. These are very important for
you to get a much calming sense of your space and the colours are soothing too.
4. Notebooks =============================== If we have a good note of things ,
half of your work is done. Do write some good notes whenever you work. Leave
some spaces in between topics so that you can add new knowledge later.  5.
Sticky Notes =============================== Keep sticky notes and write down
things of priorities like first thing in the morning etc.  6. Organizer
=============================== If you have a lot of mess on your table like
papers, books, pen etc. , then have an organizer, allocate space for every
single item. Messy works space always loses your productivity.  7. To do list
=============================== Have a physical or digital to-do list beside you
for the entire day. It helps you keep track of things and leaves procrastination
aside.  8. Water Bottle ===============================  Stay hydrated! Keep a
reusable water bottle or a cup of water close to you at all times when you’re
working hard.  It will give you a clearer mind and allow you to keep energized
throughout your work

 Instead of glasses, one could just install f.lux. It adjusts your computer
screen according to the time of day. More red in the evenings, the time where
you should be limiting the blue light. Highly recommend. 
 
     If all your screens are AMOLED, then sure, it's comparable. But if your monitor is an LCD, then it won't
    be nearly as good as glasses.

     You can't necessarily have the blue blocking software on every screen you encounter. So that makes the
    glasses a bit more practical.

     Apparently some say only the amber tinted glasses actually block blue light.   Though I too have flux
    installed.



 I prefer schedules over to-do lists. I don't know, lists make me feel guilty
when I'm not working. Schedules are dedicated to one thing. If it's fun or time
to read, that's all I'm doing.   Plants, by the way! Interesting choice! 
 
     So do you schedule your free time as well? If so what does that look like?

     Essentially you're doing a more GTD way of planning things.      You make a schedule of subjects (like
    mailbox) or based on priorities (like P1) and work exclusively on those things in that time period. It's a
    nice way of doing things.



 Noise Cancelling headphones are a must after you give them a try. They're
absolute game changers!  For people that are new to NC great opitons are: Sony
WH-1000XM4, Bose 700s and Airpods Pro, but compared to the other ones i listed
they're not the best at NC. But they're great overall 
 
     +1 for the Sony WH-1000xm4. Stellar headphones and Sony finally has multiple device pairing and you can
    have it calibrate based on location and movement. So good that I went and got the Wf-1000xm3 earbuds for
    when I’m walking the dog/want something light. Big case but that battery will outlive the sun.

     Anker soundcore life Q30s are arguably on par with the Sony and Bose. They won't break the bank as they
    are only $80 with ANC. If you want to get an ANC headphone, I would highly recommend the Ankers. You can
    also check YT reviews as there a number of people who swear by them.

     Oh what I’d give to get rid of my tinnitus and be able to use headphones again, but especially noice
    cancelling ones. 😭

     the airpods that is?

     What's the best cheap NC headphones that won't hurt my ears? I don't care about name brand just something
    that works very well and is quite cheap.

     Buy the Bose 700s if you have frequent calls / meetings. They work wonders for blocking background noise.
    I once had noisy background construction and my co-workers could barely hear it. With my AirPods Pros, any
    sound in my environment leaks through.  EDIT: check out
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_pyL4zwCbcI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyL4zwCbcI) , around 1:14,

     somebody somehwere said sitting is the new smoking, so I guess standing while working somewhereis a better
    habbit

     I've gotten good mileage out of a yoga ball. It's the right height for my normal, non-standing desk, but
    still lets me switch to something more active than my regular office chair.



 Blue light can disrupt your sleep patterns but enough exposure to blue light
during day time can also help you maintain a sleep pattern and increase
productivity. It's best to limit it in the evening.

 Truth. Noise cancellation is incredible. I didn’t think it would make that much
of a difference but it really does. 
 


 Not that the variety matters, but what are some good plants to get for the
office that require little maintenance? 
 
     Indoor plants that I've found to be super awesome and forgiving:  -Snake plant, also called mother in
    law's tongue.  -Schefflera, or umbrella plant. Super forgiving and nice and big plant. I gave one to my
    mom a year ago for mother's day and it's still alive and she can't keep any plants alive lol.  -Pothos. It
    needs a bit more water, but if you put a wick and a water catching tray you're set. Plus pothos looks
    great hanging on the wall.  -Pretty much any plant from the Dracaena genus. Which is great because there's
    a huge variety of colors and sizes in this plant group.  -Spider fern. Also a good hanging plant and makes
    babies on the end of it's leaves that you can propagate.  -Peace lily. Likes low light.  -Any type of
    succulent or cactus. Just give them rocky soil and a nice watering every week or so and they'll thrive in
    pretty much any light condition. Plus there's a huge variety so they are fun to collect.  -Aloe vera. I
    think it's a succulent but it's especially easy and nice. Plus it is good for wounds lol.  Some of these
    plants like snake plant, dracaena, and pothos can apparently filter toxins from your air. So that's a nice
    perk too.

     Ferns are always nice, don't need a lot of water. Peace lillies just droop when they need water and perk
    up again when you give it (about once a week for mine). Both are also great for oxygen :)

     >  what are some good plants to get for the office that require little maintenance?  I was rooming with a
    bunch of guys once, and when we went our separate ways, we found a plant called a Mother-in-Law's Tongue
    sitting on a window sill, forgotten for months but doing just fine.

     Pothos are great!   Zizi plants are also low maintenance, they also don't require that much light if your
    office doesn't have a window

     Spider plants, pothos (devils ivy) you can’t kill either

     I have an orchid that has survived forever with neglect

     I'm a fan of jade plants in the office. They're really striking to look at, and if your office has the
    right light, they require very little maintenance. Just water once every week or so and call it good.



 I have and use all of these things and still suck at being productive 😭 
 


 Blue light:  If you have a Windows computer or an iOS device, you should be able
to turn ""Night light"" on in the settings. Personally, I have mine set to \~80.
There doesn't seem to be an option to switch it on permanently, so I set it to
turn off at 3:45 am and turn back on at 4 am.  Once you start with reducing blue
light, it will be likely to be strange/uncomfortable to look at. Give it a week
or so. I'm now at the point where regular screens are uncomfortable to look at.

How to Start Being More Productive When You're In a Rut,"How to Start Being More Productive When You're In a Rut

Everyone goes through phases of low motivation and monotony. In these times, the
comfortable is remarkably tempting, and the fruitful is insipid. These seasons
of tedium can last days, weeks, or even months. Often you might find yourself
feeling like a passive observer of your own life. You wake up, go through the
motions, stop to sleep, then repeat. It's like the depressing version of playing
*Red Light Green Light* as a kid.  Three steps can get you out of this pit.
(Technically, I guess reading this could be considered an additional first step,
so if that's all you can muster right now, consider it a success).  ## STEP 1:
IDENTIFY THAT YOU'RE IN A RUT  The danger of these barren periods of life is
that they're easy to get into without realizing it. It's kind of like drunkenly
stumbling into a Denny's at 2AM. *You don't know how you got there or why, but
you know that, had you been of a clearer mind, you wouldn't have been there in
the first place*. Unfortunately, you don't realize that until you start to sober
up. Unlike being shitfaced, though, you don't need an ice bath or slap to the
face to break the spell. Instead, just look through the following symptoms.  1.
**You have no motivation**. There's a common adage among the personal
development community that *discipline trumps motivation every time*. While it's
not inaccurate, it's near impossible to break free from a rut in the absence of
motivation. 2. **Daily life lacks any sense of fulfillment**. There's a
cognitive detachment from the things you do each day and your higher purpose.
Whatever your long term goals are, you don't see how your routine contributes to
them. Sometimes, in a severe rut, you may no longer even know what your goals
are. 3. **You have no reason to look forward to your day**. You wake up
uninspired. You shower uninspired. You brush your teeth, make breakfast, and
throw up last night's Denny's uninspired. Nothing is exciting anymore. Your
entire day is just a series of steps to trudge through before crumbling into
bed. Every day is the same. 4. **You fall back on old, unhealthy habits**. Why?
Because they're simple. And, at a time where you don't seem to have any energy
and are often unhappy, they're seemingly the only viable option. These habits
may be poor eating, spending all your time in front of a screen, or even drugs
(including alcohol). 5. **Part of you wants to change**. But it's so effortless
to do what's comfortable. And so damn hard to do anything that isn't. Sticking
to the status quo means that you don't need to risk failure or pain. Luckily, if
you get to this point, you've begun your climb out.  These five things are what
differentiates a rut from a grind. Two people can have the exact same monotonous
routine. To one person, it's dreary and dull. To the other, it's all part of
their larger plan. They don't need their old unhealthy habits because what they
do each day makes them feel fulfilled. They know they're changing for the
better.  If you're the first person, but want to be the second, that's good.
But, we've already said that changing without motivation is something of a
paradox. It's like trying to drive to the gas station in a car that has nothing
in the tank. You can't stay stranded on the side of the highway, but you can't
get the engine firing. So, what do you do? Well, you start with what you *can*
do.  ## STEP 2: OPTIMIZE YOUR FUTURE SELF FOR ACTION  If you're in a rut, odds
are you can't find the drive to get yourself out of it. The physical action
required for change is too much of a roadblock. So, when people tell you, ""just
do something"", it's akin to telling a paraplegic to walk it off.  Therefore, the
first thing to do needs to be the simplest as well. **Start with self-
compassion**. When you're in a rut, it's natural to let the dickhead region of
the brain beat you up for it. (It's been a while since I studied neuroscience in
college, but I'm fairly certain this is a proper anatomical region). You may
criticize yourself for doing little of worth. As common as this is, it serves no
purpose. You can't change the actions of your past self. At all times, we do the
best that we can. So stop focusing on the things you could've ""hypothetically""
done because it's just that: hypothetical. If you could have done it, you would
have. But, you lacked the energy and a sense of purpose, so you didn't. And
that's okay, because it must be. It happened in the past, and cannot be changed.
So for it to be anything *but* okay is a waste of the limited mental resources
that you possess at this time. Forgive your past self, and work on what is
within your control: the present. It's this self-compassion that's fundamental
to lowering the depressive symptoms that can keep us in a rut.  Once you stop
bullying your past self with mental wedgies and swirlies, it becomes moderately
more feasible to make minuscule changes that can raise your overall energy
levels. Therefore, the **next step is to** **implement energizing habits without
the intention of taking action yet**. These habits are small but can help you
gather the energy needed to make more substantial steps. But, if you pressure
yourself to make these more significant moves now, you can easily fall back into
your negative self-talk. So, just do these simple things without the pressure of
needing to change anything else just yet. In order of increasing difficulty,
here are some recommended habits:  * **Drink more water**. Drinking water is an
excellent way to boost energy levels a small amount. Start easy, and just make
sure that you drink 1 extra glass of water each day. Slowly increase this amount
until you graduate to doing keg stands with the water cooler. It's recommended
that adult men drink 131 ounces per day, and adult women drink 95 ounces. (This
is about 13 cups and 9 cups, respectively). * **Get more (regular) sleep**. At
first, start by just making sure that you're getting between 7-9 hours of sleep
each night. Whether you wake up with an alarm or not, slowly roll back the time
you go to sleep by 10 minutes each night until you hit this range. The most
immediate priority should be achieving an adequate *duration*. This will be good
enough for most things. But, if you want to also ruminate less, have less
depressive symptoms, and lessen your chance of contracting chronic diseases (you
know, the secondary benefits), you should strive to sleep during times that sync
with your circadian rhythm. To do so, gradually adjust your 7-9 hours of sleep
until you're in bed between 8PM and midnight. * **Improve your diet**. In
general, you can make a few simple changes to your diet to boost your energy.
Certain fruits, namely bananas, oranges, strawberries, and apples, are
incredible for killing fatigue. Whole grains like brown rice, sweet potatoes,
quinoa, and oatmeal can alleviate lethargic feelings. Protein sources such as
fatty fish, eggs, yogurt, and beans are helpful as well. These foods contain
nutrients or minerals that either slow digestion (lengthening the energy-
sustaining benefits of the meal) or combat symptoms that cause fatigue. * **Go
for a short walk**. Evidence suggests that walking may be better than caffeine
for raising energy levels. Not only that, but it can also lift your mood. Plus,
these aspects are compounded upon if you take a walk outside in the sunlight. *
**Do a small workout**. Exercise serves all the same functions as a relaxing
walk but to a higher degree. Even 5-10 minutes can raise your heart rate enough
to get the blood pumping and bring up your energy. * **Take a cold shower**.
Later this month, I'll write a more in-depth article on this. Most of us would
sooner tongue kiss a sewer grate before willingly bathing in cold water. But, it
is incredible for more reasons than I can detail here. Most importantly, though,
if you can find the discipline to take a cold shower, you can undoubtedly get
yourself out of a rut.  Keep working at these habits until you feel like you can
take a small step forward. Then, depending on your task, find out ways to
facilitate that type of work. For example, walking can improve creativity by an
average of 60%. So, before creative work, it can be helpful to stroll around the
block. You may also find it useful to put on music (instrumental if the lyrics
are distracting) or create a mind map or creativity journal. For more pedestrian
work, caffeine will boost problem-solving ability but not creativity. In
addition, you can make sure that you clear your environment of any distractions,
and establish a potent reward for doing some work.  ## STEP 3: UTILIZE THE
2-5-10 PRINCIPLE  The *2-5-10 principle* is the name I've given to a
productivity method that has given me the most success in life. Like most
everything I write, it's merely a compilation of the work of those who are much
smarter than I. Still, it's a handy mnemonic to remember four invaluable
techniques.  When you finally cultivate the energy to take action, it's
essential to not let your perception of the task overwhelm you into inactivity.
Therefore, **tell yourself that you only need to work on it for 2 minutes**.
This concept, popularized by James Clear, is prominent in the habit-forming
community. By committing to such a short time, you eliminate many of the excuses
that may deter you from starting. If you can't commit to 2 minutes, try 30
seconds. Then one minute, then two. Start as small as you need. All that matters
is *that you start*.  The ""5"" is based on the 5-Second Rule by Mel Robbins. It
translates to this: **if you** **feel apprehensive or nervous about doing
something uncomfortable, count down from five in your head**. When you hit zero,
*go do that thing*. The logic behind this is that you're taking action before
your brain can overthink the situation and discourage you. You're not giving
your anxiety enough time to kick up its feet and get comfortable. Some of you
may have even stumbled upon this in the past without realizing it. (This was the
case for me when I started taking cold showers). It can be employed in anything
from a HIIT workout to social anxiety.  While both of the preceding sections
refer to techniques used to start positive habits, the third portion refers to
resisting the temptation of negative urges. In his book *The Science of Self-
Discipline*, Peter Hollins discusses his Ten-Minute Rule. **Whenever you're
tempted to engage in a bad habit, wait ten minutes.** Set a timer, and if you
still feel the urge by the time it rings, go ahead and give in. (Or, set a timer
for another ten minutes, because you survived Round 1). This takes the
""immediate"" out of *immediate gratification*. Better yet, if you find a reliable
way to counter that urge during that time, you improve your chances of making a
healthier choice after the allotted time.  The fourth and final application of
this principle is represented in how it is laid out. The numbers are ordered
from lowest to highest, which represents the concept of **always scale up**.
With each of these methods, you're starting with a relatively short response
time. As you progress, so too should this interval. Once it gets easy to stick
to a habit for 2 minutes, do so for 5 minutes, then 10. If your anxiety adapts
to kicking in in under 5 seconds, increase your response time. Count down from
4, then 3, and so on until you don't even need to think about it. Are you still
frequently having urges after 10 minutes? Try 12, then 15. A rut is an abyss of
nothingness. *To rise out of an abyss, you must scale upwards, one step at a
time*.  The important thing is that you're taking it one step at a time, always
putting one foot in front of the next. You need to crawl before you can walk,
walk before you run, and run before you do some sick nasty parkour. So make your
next step inviting and pursue it.  ## ACTION STEP  You may find yourself reading
this at the end of the day, and you might be drained of the little energy you
had at the start. So, I'll make this step as simple as possible. (After all,
that has been a central tenet of this post).  So, try making a bingo card of
small things that you can strive for tomorrow, and pick a reward for getting
""bingo"".. If you're feeling even more ambitious, you can also assign a reward
for completing the entire card. Try to pick a reinforcer that's in line with the
improvements you're trying to make. So, if you've chosen the reward of *snorting
a cigarette filled with black tar heroin*, I'd highly encourage you to find
another option. Sorry for the inconvenience.

 As someone who's been in a deep rut for a few months, thank you for this 🙏 
 
     It’s a difficult time; hope this helps!

     Bro same. Let’s go.



 This is wonderfully written, thanks for sharing. It’s been so easily to fall and
remain in a rut with everything that’s been going on :’) 
 
     Yes absolutely! Take it slow and remember to be kind with yourself, good luck!



 Excellently written, and very helpful. Posts like these are what make Reddit so
great: real people helping each other solve problems. Like the majority of
comments here, I thank you for posting this. 
 
     Thank you, that’s very kind of you! I hope that this helps you



 Ahahahahaha love the bingo, gonna do it in...*begins 5 s count down* 
 
     Flawless.



 Nicely layed out, thanks. Haven't heard of a few of these methods. 
 
     Glad I was able to show you some new things!



 Needed to hear and see this. Thanks for the share. 
 
     Good luck friend!



 Concerning energizing habits, I would say be completely aware of your thoughts
and feeling every moment as they come up... 
 
     Oh absolutely. Emotional intelligence is vital when it comes to self improvement. Do you find that
    awareness to be something that energized you?

     Mindfulness could help with this



 My rut started a few days ago and got really bad today. I read this, grabbed a
cup of water, and ""worked"" out for 10 minutes.   I'll keep trying these steps
and see where I end up.   Thanks. 
 
     That’s fantastic. Honestly, keep celebrating any victory like that because that’s what matters in the long
    run. Keep crushing it.



 Thank you for taking the time to write this out for us :’) I found this
extremely helpful for where I am right now 
 
     I’m just happy that it can help people - I love writing this kind of stuff, so thank you for taking the
    time to read it!



 just what I needed, thanks!

I use iPhone Reminders to put my life on autopilot. No more forgotten tasks.,"I use iPhone Reminders to put my life on autopilot. No more forgotten tasks.

Hey everyone. JD here again. This is one of my favorite productivity strategies.
For real, my phone screen right now says, ""Check in with Jordan"", and ""Water
Bonsai tree tonight."" So easy. Here we go:  ## IPHONE REMINDERS  iPhone
reminders is an app that many people have decided not to use at all. It seems
like it conflicts with other scheduling and task apps such as Google Calendar or
Notes.  But Reminders comes with a few unique features that makes it perfect for
the system we’ve outlined below. A few of them include:  **Date and time** –
Instead of just a checklist that can easily be forgotten, you can set your
reminders to appear exactly when you need them.  **Notifications** – Just like
with most apps, you have a few notification settings available. You can make
Reminders so annoying you won’t be able to forget them: noises, badges,
permanent banners, and more.  **Siri** – You can simply ask Siri to “Remind me
to do \*task\* at \*date and time\*.” And it will automatically be added to your
reminders.  **Organization** – Use the colored labeling system to seperate your
reminders into different parts of your life.  **Locations** – By letting
Reminders know certain locations like your home, work, or local grocery store,
your reminders can pop up whenever you reach that area.  **Recurring** – You may
need to be reminded of certain things once a week or once a month. You can make
recurring reminders that get checked off and reappear during the next deadline.
**Priority** – You can also assign a priority to each reminder, from ! to !!!.
Now, this might be a useful feature to you, but sometimes this makes you feel
like you can just ignore the lower priority items. Beware.  ## WHEN TO USE
REMINDERS:  The simple answer? Constantly. Every single time something “comes
across your desk” that you need to remember, you should simply tell Siri what
and when, and then you can forget about it.  No more going through a mental
checklist three times a day, trying to remember what your partner shouted at you
to pick up while you were driving away, or what time and day you needed to be
available for trivia night. Examples include:  \+ Grocery lists  \+ Meetings  \+
Phone calls  \+ Errands  \+ Upcoming events  \+ Chores  But what might be even
more valuable than just sporadic reminders is setting up a consistent schedule
to automate all those tasks you need to remember each and every week. Here’s the
best one in the world to get your started. Call up Siri right now and say,
**“Remind me to take out the garbage** **every week** **on \*day and time\*.”**
Done. For the rest of your life, no more waking up to the sound of the garbage
truck and running down the driveway in your way-too-revealing bathrobe.  Other
recurring reminders you could set up include:  \+ Weekly check ins with family
or friends  \+ Daily reminders to get up and stretch  \+ Birthday reminders for
those close to you  \+ Monthly medication refills  \+ Daily medication reminders
\+ Feeding pets when arriving at home  \+ Checking your schedule when you get to
work  ## MOVING FORWARD  By now, your reminder setup should be looking pretty
powerful. Make sure you complete each task as soon as you get the notification,
or else you run the risk of forgetting about it even after you’ve done all this
organizational work! Cheers guys, hope this helps.  EDIT: Since this is getting
some attention I wanted to link my original [post](https://conquer.today/iphone-
reminders/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=iphone+reminders&utm
_content=iphone+reminders&utm_term=r+productivity) that has step-by-step
screenshots of the setup which could be helpful, and then
[this](https://conquer.today/run-entire-life-simple-notes-app/?utm_medium=social
&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=notes+app&utm_content=iphone+reminders&utm_term=

post that here next week. Mods, please let me know if these links are not okay
and I will remove them as soon as I see it.

     Things looks pretty interesting I'm going to take a look at it.



 Not that I use it that often, but Reminders + Apple Watch is a powerful combo. 
 
     I bet. I'm not that plugged in yet

     Agreed! Takes it to a whole new level



 Reminders is a lifesaver.  I literally use it for everything, no matter how
trivial the task.  My work productivity is through the roof, and everyone thinks
I’m a genius because they think I’ve remembered that little thing someone said X
days/weeks ago.  My wife thinks I’m silly because sometimes When I’m with her
and something pops up in my mind that i should remind myself later, I’ll talk
into siri and ask for a new reminder. She’s always making fun of me because of
that haha 
 
     Better than forgetting it!



 Agree. Recently started using. Super helpful. 
 
     Nice. Any standard ones you would add to the list?

     Solid list.  I’d like to point out how useful the subtask function is. It really allows you to fine tune
    tasks requiring multiple steps. The ability to share email text from the Mail app is also a nice addition.



 [deleted] 
 
     Nice. Yeah Reminders syncs too but I don't touch it there. I like when people recommend PC / Android stuff
    in these posts



 More features:  * You can add some contact to remind yourself and when you use
iMessage with that user, reminder will pop to remind you. * If you paste a link
to URL, you will get a bubble of the website to easily click. * You can add
image to your reminder. * You can scan a document to add into that Reminder *
You can add note to your reminder, where you may write a subscription price
there to remind you how much that subscription costs on that monthly reminder. *
While you're on the stock apps, such as Mail,Safari you can ask Siri ""Remind me
this"" and Siri will create a reminder with that contents link on it (you can
click a mail from reminder, or ""Look at the webpage later"" sense. * You can
share reminders with family members or any iOS users.  There are coming nice
things to Apple Reminders on iOS 14 too.  * On shared lists, you can assign a
reminder to someone in that list. * New reminder detail design that looks sick! 
 
     Nice!! Upvote this



 I feel like a lot of people just instinctively don’t want to use the built in
stock apps, but Reminders is great. The overall integration with the OS really
makes it useful. 
 
     Yeah, true... I actually extensively use the Notes app because it's the only one that opens fast enough
    lol. Everything else is in Drive.



 Sadly, I’ve started using Alexa to remind me of everything. It works on
household chores and forces hubby to get his to-do lists around the house
without me having to nag him....now Alexa rules him :) 
 
     Haha slippery slope, wait until you catch them home alone listening to Despacito



 Oh god. I'd like to use reminders but after living at home again for a few
months, reminders make me want to chuck my phone through a window.  My mom has
reminders for **everything** and uses an alert that's loud and strobes the phone
flashlight. She always leaves her phone around the house so my sister and I were
having to get up every five minutes to shut off the alerts. It also goes off at
dinner. No amount of begging got her to change it to silent. I swear I almost
""accidentally"" smashed it with a hammer. 
 
     hahaa



 Is there any way in settings to make the reminders nag you more? I always end up
finding reminders from a month ago that I didn’t end up doing 
 
     If the reminder has a specific time set ""remind me in 2 hours to take out the laundry"" or ""remind me to
    take out the trash on thursday at 6pm"", then the reminder will stay on your home screen FOREVER and never
    go away until you check it off.  If you dont specify a time and just say ""Remind me to feed the cats"". It
    will just hide in the list and not nag you .

     Hm. Nothing that I've found out. Just make sure they stick on your home notifications screen, as long as I
    don't clear it they are there every time I look at my phone. Even if I clear it I think they come back
    actually

     You can change the notification settings of reminders app so every notification can stay on your screen
    until you erase it manually .[https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/17/how-to-persistent-
    notifications/](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/17/how-to-persistent-notifications/)

     Instead of Reminders, you can use the app called Due. It's stellar at nagging and you can set up to use it
    with Siri.  Lack of nagging is why I don't use Reminders.  Another app I like is called Reminder by Aida
    Organizer.  HTH

The only thing that’s ever worked for my phone addiction: lock it up!,"The only thing that’s ever worked for my phone addiction: lock it up!

I have a bad relationship with my phone. When I’m bored or anxious, I end up
scrolling and can waste hours. I've tried different apps over the years but the
only solution that has consistently worked for me is really basic: locking my
phone away in a clear plastic box with a timer lock that I cannot open until
time is up. There is NO OVERRIDE. You can’t restart it, pull the batteries, or
hack your way out.   I stumbled on this technique 10+ years ago during my grad
school. One of Richard Thaler (the Nobel prize guy)'s students gifted one to me.
Then I noticed Thaler wrote it in his book Nudge. Basically the thought is don't
try to use your willpower. Make a commitment ahead of time and make your
temptation impossible.  Since then, I’ve finished my phd dissertation, survived
multiple job market cycles, launched my career, moved a few times, but I still
keep my ""phone case"" wherever I go. Sometimes I even lock it for a whole
weekend, and suddenly I’m actually enjoying life instead of getting sucked into
endless scrolling.  Some tricks I’ve learned over the years:  * I got a
transparent box, so if I get a 2-step verification code over message, I just
shake the phone inside to light up the screen and read it. * I got an apple
watch, so again if there is a 2-step verification I can do it on my watch. * I
still have my laptop, so I can make calls and check iMessages. * If I know my
phone is going to be in there for days, I throw in a power bank so the phone
doesn’t die. * I’ve only ever had to break the box once. It was sort of a true
emergency. Replacing the base was expensive, so honestly the cost alone deters
me from ever doing that again...  There’s something deeply satisfying about
knowing I can’t cave even if I wanted to.

 Can confirm, I got a timed lock box for my phone a while ago and it's amazing.
Mine is phone sized, and is not clear but it has a window that allows me to
answer calls and turn off alarms but not much else. 
 
     Wow curious to see what that window looks like! Do you have a link or picture?



 My issue is what if there is a genuine emergency? How would loved ones reach
you?

     Start a click jar, open an app that counts clicks(i used to have one that traces your mouse movement and
    draws a picture in the end) and decide on something you want to buy and put in lime 5-10 cents per click.
    Get really poor real quick haha.



 nah i'd be broke 
 
     Phrase of the day: ""Time poor""



 Or you can set timers on the apps you use most :) I did that for Instagram and
other social channels. I have a 30 minute daily timer, and I do not adjust it
once it is hit. Doing this has drastically reduced the amount of time I spend on
my phone. I also deleted a ton of apps. Before taking this initiative I was
spending 4-5 hours a day on my phone. I am now down to 3-3.5. I would like it to
be 2-2.5 
 
     What's the app?



 Considering I do a lot of my free time I earn as well as my hobbies on my
computer mainly, I would definitely just get insanely more depressed. 
 


 That's not a bad idea for an app 
 
     I already working on a productivity app but for phone unlocks. And got thinking about our general
    interaction with the device.



 I love this metaphor. Well done. 
 


 actually we do, while we give them our time, they gain money with the adds we
saw, but since yesterday I'm quitting all social media, just allowing me to use
reddit 15min each 4 hours max (to see useful post), and I'm not watching youtube
recommended anymore, the only way I'll be able to watch a video is looking for
it on google and then go to youtube, so I don't see the recommended. Also, I
can't use any of that on my phone. I'll follow this for a month and see how it
goes, I'm hoping this time I could do something with my life. 
 


 Probably not, in the long run it'd mean I'd reorganize my entire life around
making money and wouldn't be able to find joy in doing things online anymore.
Sounds a lot like selling my soul. Or at the very least I'd just learn to not
use computers and go back to reading books, newspapers, and magazines. Strong
pass. 
 
     Was actually just gonna say this! Humans have the tendency to be fairly good at adapting while also being
    incredibly risk/lose averse. So if you had to pay everytime you used your phone only for the chance of
    seeing something interesting idk how many people would still use them... Then again slot machines are a
    thing I suppose 🤔

     Yep, because doing things in the real world and learning/practicing new skill = selling soul for money
    making.     You're brilliant.

What's helped you best on maintaining a healthy boundary between your phone/online usage?,"What's helped you best on maintaining a healthy boundary between your phone/online usage?

I notice I do well for a few weeks keeping screen time to a fair amount when
everything's going smooth and then it always seems like I have a low will power
week with bad sleep or after drinking where I get 6+ hours of junk content.
Things I've tried:  Keeping social media app on Bluestacks App Desktop instead
of phone (No discipline I just redownload them on my phone)  ScreenZen /
StayFocusd / Apple Screen time (Just click through to use)   (If I'm willing to
do it, a lot of days hard to force myself to do it)  Is the only magic bullet
keeping my willpower high with Mediation, good sleep, diet, and no alcohol use?
It's weird because I'm mostly disciplined across all other  commonly Addictive
domains but somehow phone addictions killer how it creeps into your life more
and more.   What's worked for you?

 I block social media on my phone and computer every weekday between 8am and 2pm.
When I get the urge to scroll, I read on my Kindle. 
 


 What times of the day do you find yourself scrolling when the willpower is low? 
 


 Great question: I set the time for phone/online usage and for other stuffs (you
can say offline). I never touch the phone in the morning tea with my WIFEE. We
both don't pick the phone at that time, we just talk and read the newspaper.
Then, I set the time for my kids in the evening. There are many other things
which I manage as per the situation or workload.   However, you need to fight
yourself for this which is the biggest fight.   What do you think? 
 


 My mindset, tbh. When I want to use social media, no freaking apps can stop me.
But once I clear my mind, I can just hide the app (on iphone) and won't use it
for more than 10mins a day 
 


 My brain does the work. It leads to discipline.  Discipline leads to commitment.
Commitment leads to a better life, in any aspect, not just screens.  It's
straightforward.

10 digital minimalism tips that are helping me curb my phone addiction 💭,"10 digital minimalism tips that are helping me curb my phone addiction 💭

I've been addicted to my phone for years, and recently discovered that I was
spending up to 6 hours a day looking at my phone. Not only was this making me
less productive, but it was also making me overwhelmed and unhappy. But, I've
finally committed to doing something about it.  So, since listening to the
Digital Minimalism audiobook, here are **ten steps I'm taking to become**
***less*** **addicted to my phone. ☎️**  1. **Downsize** \- Since downsizing
from a 6.5"" Android to an iPhone mini, I use my phone a lot less, since it is
much less enjoyable to binge content. 2. **Delete Apps & Social Media** \- I've
started a 30-day social media detox — deleting about half the apps on my phone
(including social media apps), stopped consuming the news, and blocking those
sites on my computer. I'm currently on day 11 😌 3. **Clear Your Home Screen** 📱-
Out of sight, out of mind, right? I keep essential apps, like Settings or Maps
or Venmo in my App Library instead of my home screen for when I actually need
them (<5% of the time). 4. **Turn off Notifications** \- I'm always anxious
about what's going on on my phone -- and used notifications as an excuse to pick
up my phone. By turning them off, I am a lot more intentional about when I
choose to pick up my phone. 5. **Keep Phone Physically Away** \- By keeping my
phone face down, or several steps away, or even powered off, my laziness will
get in the way of me actually using my phone. 6. **Use Other Devices -** Since
getting an Apple Watch, I'm a lot more comfortable keeping my phone away, since
I can do basic tasks, like calls, check the weather, change the music, etc. on
my watch. 7. **Declutter Your Content Feed** \- When I *am* using my phone, I
want that experience to be as positive as possible. So, I unsubscribed to all my
spam emails and cleaned out my YouTube subscription box -- so the content I
consume is *optimized* to bring me value. 8. **Do Not Disturb Mode** \-
Settings, like Do Not Disturb Mode and time limits through the Screen Time
widget, are really helpful in nudging you away from using your phone. I have a
schedule turned on to always enable Do Not Disturb mode at night. 9. **Take
Offline Breaks -** By being intentional about how I use my breaks, and choosing
to take a walk or grab some water instead of checking my phone, I feel a lot
more refreshed and productive. 10. **Mindset Shift** 🧠  - If I'm being honest
with myself, I've tried this before -- telling myself I need to 'use my phone
less.' But, without strict rules (like a detox) or a strong reason for doing so
(curbing my addiction), the habits never stuck. This time, I've really come to
terms with the damage my phone usage was doing to my mental wellbeing and
productivity. And as a result, I am a lot more committed to making these changes
stick for the long term.  Quite frankly, I've got a lot of work myself to do in
this regard, but these steps have been really helpful in helping me curb my
smartphone addiction. I'm also documenting my journey with implementing digital
minimalism on my [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/uL7WvJT_FOg) — first with my
productivity apps, and now with my phone -- if you're interested in content like
this!✨  Cheers! ✌🏽

 Very helpful. Thanks for taking the time to do this.  I have both ADHD and
massive anxiety issues, so my devices are an incessant source of distraction, so
I've been trying to develop a healthier relationship and to use them more
healthily.  My recent developments are:  1) Printed out a page that says ""Don't
login until you've made a To-Do list"", which is to remind me to have a plan when
I get on the device so that I don't end of spending countless hours
doomscrolling and watching yt videos.  2) Got a mini-flip notebook for my to do
list. Write out what my plan is and estimated time. I cross off each task as I
complete and go directly to the next.   3) Part of my anxiety is fear of the
unknown and future, so I need to check news periodically, but I limit my time to
check out general events. 
 
     I love that term, ""doomscrolling""! Thank you for sharing your tips.



 I simply love do not disturb mode. Since I’m working with colleagues in a
different time zone, it’s a life safer. Another tip would be to charge your
phone in another room overnight. Hence, no phone before sleep and after wake up.
And sound healthy sleep is the key, a silver bullet if you may. 
 


 Very useful for me! Thank you! 
 


 6 hours a day?? I’m doing 11+ fuck 😳 
 
     I spent 79 hours on my phone last week 🤢🤮 Absolutely disgusting I hate it.

     I’m so glad I’m not the only one 😫😫



  **Keep Phone Physically Away** \-   how do you convince yourself to move the
phone away? 
 
     I put my phone in a drawer in another room for a period of time and set a timer (i.e. 30 minutes).  That
    eliminates anxiety/decision-making on when I will pick up my phone again and allows me to focus.

     &#x200B;  I tell myself the only people who ABSOLUTELY NEED to have a cell phone on them at all time are
    people in emergency services like doctors (my mum gets emergency case calls from hospital quite often),
    Cops, fire fighters, etc.  Once you let go of your mobile device and engage with people & activities
    around you, it's something you'll appreciate .Sometimes I forget my phone for more than hours when
    involved with things happening around me.

     Throw it to the desired spot and don't look back.

     I make it a challenge for myself. First, I want to see if I can be away from my phone for half an hour.
    Then an hour. Or if I'm doing something where I want to be present (like watching a movie, perhaps), I
    make the intentional decision to leave my phone in my room before heading downstairs.



 great advice! 
 


 Great list. It can be tough.   I'd add muting Whatsapp groups. Hardly any of
them need to be checked more than once per day. 
 
     Yes!! I mute all groups except my family's group chat.



 I just muted two WhatsApp groups and moved all social media apps to my 2nd
screen to make them slightly less accessible—thanks! 
 


 Do Not Disturb is such a blessing, I use it all the time now only allowing
Signal to go through (since its how I talk to my s.o) and some contacts from
work through SMS/phone calls.

How I was Finally able to Beat procrastination after lots of trials,"How I was Finally able to Beat procrastination after lots of trials

Hello Everyone,  I tried a lot to beat my procrastination habit but I failed
almost every time and can't explain the guilt after that.  Tried setting alarms,
tried to wake up early nothing worked. Finally, after I was fed up.  I Changed
from forcing myself to trying to figure out how I can be consistent and beat
procrastination.  Here is my learning  1. **Diet plays a huge role**. I felt
sleepy/lethargic every time I even thought of starting anything. So first thing
I tried was to reduce the amount of food intake(no other change in diet food I
ate was as before).  It gave better results than expected my focus improved
dramatically and was more willing to start things. 2. **Water intake**  This was
a suggestion from a friend I kept a bottle near me whenever I started working.
Took a sip or two every few minutes. Not sure how but it helped Me keep
concentration levels for a long time actually worked better than Coffee for me.
3. **A clear list of things broken into tiny chunks** After a lot of hit and
trial I figured out that my mind was willing to stay on tasks which are clear
and very precise instead of something broad 4. **Create a List for next day Last
night before sleeping** 5. **Use a habit tracking app**  I wanted to learn **App
Development and was procrastinating for months** on it. So I broke it into tiny
chunks.  Started with making a list of the video tutorial I need to watch. Exact
Topic of the day that I had to read.  Once I learnt basic things best way
forward was to have a precise App that I will build to keep learn and be on
track.  Created lists for each screen. Whenever felt stuck in a bug or issue. I
broke the list even more. Somedays I just had one task Crystal clear to Fix a
bug and my mind was automatically focused on that. Things started working and I
was finally able to complete the app.  **Can't tell you the feeling and
confidence it gave me.**  Apple store Link to the basic app I created if you
want to check  [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grocery-shopping-list-

 >water intake  This reminds me of a pro-study tip I read about. They mention
that it was the one thing they always saw pro studiers do. Have a drink of water
nearby.  I thought it was dumb and skeptical but honestly, I see the purpose
now. It gives you something to focus on when your mind drifts away, it keeps you
hydrated but doesn't distract you so it helps keep your flow and momentum going
with the added benefit of hydrating you!  Side note: Are there any apps you
recommend that help visually show progress and break down tasks? 
 
     OP's list follows very closely to my own journey.  I tried a lot of different apps and settled on Todoist
    to keep a breakdown of what specifically needs done for each project.

     It doesn't help break down tasks but showing progress and keeping you consistently accountable I use

 Bro agreed, this worked wonders for me too. Right now im back in a small rut coz
i started eating shit again but its good to know i have the solution. 
 


 [deleted] 
 
     Yeah I saw in a self help video this suggestion.  You have to remember how long your body takes to convert
    things like carbs into energy. It has to use energy itself which can make you feel sluggish.  I've been
    experimenting with fasting and now I'm on OMAD and pretty stoked with it.

     THATS WHY I DONT DO WORK AFTER I EAT



 I feel like with the entire diet thing, it's also worth noting. That drinking
caffeine 1st thing in the morning, is actually the most useless time to drink
caffeine.   Caffeine is barely a central nervous system stimulant to begin with,
it does not bind directly to any dopamine receptors at all. It's an adenosine
antagonist, what this means is that, instead of stimulating on it's own (like
nicotine, amphetamine, cocaine, methylphenidate etc.) it prevents the neural
depression caused by a build up of adenosine. Throughout the day, you build up
adenosine levels as you're awake and as you're brain is active. After you meet
certain parameters of being awake and you're brain functioning, a certain amount
of that adenosine building up throughout the day will depress neural signaling
at specific concentrations. Slowly leading to promoting and inducing sleepiness
by the end of the day. Then you go to sleep, and you reset the concentration,
back to the starting point.   So when you drink a bunch of caffeine 1st thing in
the morning, you're getting fuck all benefit in comparison to later in the day,
but you're still getting all the negatives full brunt. Toxicity, tolerance
increase, cardiotoxicity, drug-interactions, adverse reactions (especially
gastro intestinal, anxiety, and blood-pressure related ones), lowering the
seizure threshold, potential electrolyte imbalances via dehydration (also most
people don't consume pure caffeine via tablets/pills which is much more
financially efficient, but then there's also the acidity of things like coffee
etc.) Now this doesn't apply to certain applications of caffeine, if your using
caffeine for it's ability to potentiate analgesics like acetaminophen, then that
will still work fine, not a preferable treatment for asthma but it's effect as
bronchodilator wouldn't be significantly impacted either. But most people think
caffeine helps them feel awake in the morning, when in reality what's occurring
is, they've consumed caffeine for a long period of time chronically, they have a
developed dependence on it, so they wake up in withdrawal from caffeine.
Obviously administering caffeine then reverses the withdrawal, so they don't
feel the effects like cognitive dysfunction, headaches, sleepiness/drowsiness
from withdrawal, rather than caffeine giving any significant stimulant effect.
It's also just the sympathetic stimulant effects as well, the increase in
thermogenesis, the increased emptying of the gastro intestinal tract, the
increased blood pressure and higher heart rate, things that are achievable by
doing 10 push ups.   So quit caffeine addictions, then use caffeine sparingly
around those afternoon crashes, it will be much more effective, always start
with a lower dose as your tolerance may or may not decrease significantly. If
you're usual afternoon crash is at 2pm, take caffeine (preferably as a pill so
it's all at once and not gradual) 75-90 minutes prior to that time you crash.
Don't chronically use it, or it will fuck up your circadian rhythm and cause
more harm than good. I used to take grams of caffeine daily from 3rd grade to
8th. I'm not against caffeine at all, but it should be utilized propperly.
(also make sure you're not trying to self medicate something like mild
narcolepsy, other sleep disorders or ADHD as those are very common occurrences
of people trying to self medicate with things like caffeine rather than talking
to their doctor.)

 Thanks for sharing  ! As a procrastinator working to beat it I am learning mind
mapping and I think will try to apply it to the point 3 . 
 
     Could you say more about how you use mind mapping and what it does for you that lists don’t? Very curious.



 Thank you for sharing your progress! It's inspiring to see someone who also
struggles with chronic procrastination get out of bad habits and work to achieve
their goals. \^\_\^ 
 


 Wow, wait. This is EXACTLY the kind app I was looking for.   Gonna try it out. I
really want something that just takes my recipes and just creates a list for me
without me having to go through the whole process of listing it out. 
 


 A “non negotiable 3 things I gotta do tomorrow” list is an awesome trick!   And
fasting until your blood sugar stabilizes is also surprisingly effective.

I have a very important exam tomorrow, and since I had an even more important
exam on Tueasday, I could barely study for it, so last night I decided to turn
off my phone. I told my gf what I was going to do so she wouldn't be expecting
any messages from me the following day, and I turned it off at around 10:30pm
yesterday.  Jump to 3pm today and I had no phone screen time whatsoever (of
course), and it felt so good. I was able to focus so much on my studying, I
spent time outside, went for a walk, took a nap, watched an episode of a TV show
(I highly recommend it, ""Shrinking"" on Apple TV+) and still studied for hours.
I'll definitely be doing this more often. It's almost 10pm right now and only
had 10 minutes of non-productive screen time (\~40mins in total but most of it
is texting and stuff).  Edit: sorry for my english

 Yep. It’s amazing what you can do when you just turn it off or put it in another
room. Sometimes I put it away for a whole weekend just for a mental break.

Sleeping faster | My routine for a productive 5 hour sleep,"Sleeping faster | My routine for a productive 5 hour sleep

Over the years I’ve picked few things from Wim Hof, Tim Ferris, Hindu and Yoga
traditions and have compiled an evening routine that helps me reduce my sleep to
5 (ish) hours, wake up without an alarm and get a leg up on the day.  # 6pm –
Last meal of the day  Have a light dinner no later than 6pm (or 4 hours before
going to bed). It should be small so you go to bed with an empty stomach.  You
don’t want your body to be busy digesting food when it should be resting.  # 9pm
– Drink the magic potion  The magic potion is one teaspoon of raw honey and one
teaspoon apple cider vinegar.  Mixed them in warm water, just a bit above room
temperature, so the honey gets dissolved without losing its nutrients. If you
heat up honey to more than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 Fahrenheit then it’s as
good as sugar, all nutrients are gone.  # 9:30pm – Turn off all screens and
start slowing down  I was going to put 1 hour here but I know that’s impossible
for most of us. At least 30 minutes before bed stop using your phone, laptop or
TV. Some folks like to read books during this time on their Kindle paper white
or real paper books.  I’m all for education and reading. Especially if you’re
learning something new it does make sense to read about it before going to bed
and let you brain sort things out while you sleep. Sleeping is a powerful
learning tool this way.  But I am strongly against reading just for the sake of
it. So what do you do when you can’t look at any screens and don’t feel like
reading?  I’m using this time to slow down my mind and clear my thoughts. Your
mind follows your body, have you noticed how you suddenly have more confidence
when you stand up straight? (that’s for another article)  In order to slow down
the mind I slow down my breathing and my movements. Literally everything I do, I
do it slower than normal. I do some stretching, brush my teeth, do some sun
salutations, even if I’m reading I’m doing it slower. This forces my mind to
slow down and focus on these simple things I’m doing.  # 9:45pm – Take a cold
shower (Optional)  It’s still summer here and even the nights can be hot so I
take cold showers before bed almost every night. No need for soap or shampoo or
anything, I just let the water flow. Do you know that yogis (people doing yoga
all day) take 6 to 7 showers per day, just to clear their body from the
impressions of the world. And their goal is to clear their minds completely, so
it makes sense to do this when we’re trying to clear our minds at night.  Ok the
water doesn’t have to be cold, but keep it on the cooler side.  # 10:00pm – Go
to bed  This is the ideal scenario for me but I rarely manage to get it. Most
days I get to bed between 10pm and 11pm and I wake up around 4am to 4:30am max,
without an alarm. The sleeping interval is significant here. It is proven that
in the first third of the night we get the deepest part of our sleep, our *slow
wave* sleep. So it makes sense to sleep more in the first third of the night.
Also reducing our stress before going to sleep increases the duration of this
slow wave sleep. Hence the previous steps of the routine.  # 4:30 am – Wake up
and do sun salutation  This one is a bonus and part of my yoga routine. Sun
salutation is the simplest yoga practice you can do and it is supposed to be
done on sunrise and on sunset to basically salute the Sun. In Hindu tradition
they say that after a while of doing these your body comes in sync with the sun
and it naturally wants to wake up on sunrise. Here is a [short
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73sjOu0g58M) on how to do it.  #
Environment  You should be sleeping in a pitch black room. Close all curtains
and turn off all lights.  The temperature should be cool, in the summer time you
might have to open a window slightly. But if it’s too noisy outside, especially
in 10-11pm, this could be a problem. Try it both ways and do what works for you.
# Pitfalls  You already know these but for completeness I must say the obvious:
* **Alcohol** – Even one drink will hinder your sleep. Stop making the excuse
that one glass of wine is healthy to drink at night. There is only one study
that supports this wine thing every night because some french tribe was observed
with long lifetime span and they were drinking wine every day. Let me tell you
for sure that they weren’t trying to optimize their sleeping schedule. *
**Caffeine** – At least 6 hours before bed you shouldn’t be drinking coffee or
cacao, which includes chocolate too. * **Screens** – Use a blue light blocker.
[Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) works on all platforms. On Mac there is also
night shift which does the same thing. On newer phones there is reading mode
which also blocks blue light, keep that on all the time you won’t notice any
difference, but your eyes will. * **Eating sugar** – If you’re following the
routine you won’t be eating anything for the last 4 hours of your day. But on
the days when you aren’t, make sure not to eat simple sugars at night. They mess
up your whole circadian rhythm.  # Final advice  My general advice stays the
same: Don’t believe anything I say blindly. Try it for yourself. Keep the things
that work, discard the ones that don’t, add what is uniquely your own.  &#x200B;
# Edit  The point of the routine is not to cause sleep deprivation. I mentioned
few times that you shouldn't use an alarm.  The point is to do the routine, fall
asleep and then let your body wake up whenever it wants to. If not immediately,
after few days you will notice that you will start to wake up sooner. It's not
about the hours of sleep it's about restfulness, it's about quality, this
increases the quality.  **The study on sleep deprived people:** Someone
mentioned about a study done where people were sleeping 6 hours and had all
kinds of issues afterwards because of the cortisol.   If you take people that
have been sleeping for 8 hours and then force them to sleep 2 hours less without
changing anything, of course there would be trouble. Because what are normal
people doing before sleep, watching TV, eating pizza and drinking beer.  **About
honey before sleep**: A teaspoon of honey has just 5 grams of carbs but when you
mix it in warm water it becomes much quicker for your body to digest. By the
time you go to sleep 1 hour later it's already passed through the system. And
for the benefits you need to look beyond the sugar, it has tons of minerals and
compounds that no other sweetener has. It actually lowers triglycerides and
improves cholesterol levels which is counterintuitive since all other carbs make
these worse. It's easy to say, oh honey has antioxidants but so do carrots. But
there are [thousands of
antioxidants](https://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/082508p50.shtml). All
are not made the same.  And I will reiterate my final point. Don't believe
anyone on the internet says blindly. Try it for yourself it's nothing dangerous.
Nothing will happen to you if you don't eat for 4 hours and put away your phone.

 1. How long you have been doing this? 2. How much mental work do you do during
the day?   Despite all the tricks (e.g. magic potions) it looks this cannot be
maintained on the long run (without sever health problems that come from lack of
sleep). But you never know ... 
 
     Agreed. What does their day look like? Also, what age are they? This doesn’t seem sustainable or healthy.

     To add to your last point about severe health problems, I recently saw a study that showed that sleeping 6
    hours a night leads to progressive deterioration of cognitive abilities WITHOUT any symptoms of sleep
    deprivation, like feeling tired, irritable, etc.  I think they concluded that after 2 weeks, subjects who
    slept 6 hours a night over those 2 weeks had the same cognitive levels as someone who hadn't slept for 48
    hours.  So I agree that sleeping 5 hours sounds bad. Edit: I like the other tips, though. Too bad they're
    hard to habituate.

     [deleted]

     Since we know there are people functioning perfectly fine on 4 hours or less per night for years it is
    perfectly possible. But it depends 100% on the person and can not be generalized.

     I can do 4 hours a night for a couple of weeks when I have a high work load, but even if I feel productive
    and get the thing done, only after I finish do I start to realise how exhausted I really am and the toll
    it had on my body, and it takes a couple of days to recover. This can be a good short term solution if you
    have no choice but I don't think it's sustainable and it will probably be harmful long term



 [deleted] 
 
     Even if OP feels fine, he's almost certainly shortening his life by doing this.



 Everything you mention looks fine except the 6.5 hours of sleep opportunity
time. An adult needs in between 7 and 8 hours of real sleep. Anything less
causes all kinds of health issues. If you're interested in the subject of sleep,
I can recommend ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker. 
 
     This right here. Great book with some good points. OP is right that the first half of our sleep is deep,
    NREM dominant, but it definitely doesn’t mean that we don’t also need the lighter, REM sleep. Both are
    very important and work synergistically.

     Actually Dr. Walker suggests that people need closer to 9 hours of sleep rather than the commonly
    suggested 7 or 8. Only a few lucky individuals have some sort of special gene that helps them thrive on
    six hours of sleep.

     There are some people who are seemingly genetically predisposed to need less sleep.
    https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190828111247.htm  This very well could be one of those
    people. Then again, ever since I started being much more active and lost a bunch of weight, I've needed
    less sleep. So maybe person by person based on certain bodily factors there is a variability there as
    well.

     > An adult needs in between 7 and 8 hours of real sleep.  This is based on what? The average Westerner,
    who is incredibly unhealthy physically and spiritually? Buddhist monks get by with 2.



 >I am strongly against reading just for the sake of it.   I'm curious to hear
more of your thoughts here.  Beyond the obvious educational opportunities from
non-fiction, I believe recent studies have shown there are even benefits from
reading fiction.  Why are you against reading just for the sake of it? 
 
     I wondered the same thing...



 1. Your life sounds miserable if you actually live like this.   2. Humans are
not robots that can be programmed to sleep and eat only what you feel like
giving your body. Sooner or later, you will crash.  3. Honey is literally a
solution of fructose and glucose. I'm not sure what ""nutrients"" you're implying
exist in honey besides trace levels of vitamins and minerals that eating a
single carrot would provide in larger amounts.  4. There is plenty of evidence
of why ""reading for the sake of reading"" is excellent for your brain's health,
emotional regulation, and stress relief. Sounds like you need to rethink your
life strategy and do that a bit more before you spew this nonsense to other
people. 
 


 Forgot who said this but your post reminds me:  What amazes me after 36 years of
being involved in sleep research is people want to get less sleep. If I was a
nutritionist, I'd be surprised if someone asked, 'How can I eat more
unhealthily.' If I was a fitness guru, I'd find it strange if people asked, 'How
can I be more lazy?' 
 
     As a doc: this. Being able to function on less sleep is possible. Residency taught me this. But it isn’t
    healthy.



 have you aged rapidly? 
 


 Keep productivity the hell away from my sleep 
 


 What are the nutrients in honey that disappear above 40C? Where do they go? 
 
     They dissolve



 Cold shower before bed? Are you sure that we need to rise our catecholamines by
couple hundred percents to sleep better?  Also there i saw that warm bath is
pretty good for sleep quality (having it almost daily).[https://www.sciencedirec
t.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552?via%3Dihub](https://www.scienced
irect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552?via%3Dihub) 
 
     The point of the cold shower is to be cool yourself before falling asleep. It's currently summer here. In
    cold climate it doesn't matter.

Simple todo app that let’s me add task + deadline in short time,"Simple todo app that let’s me add task + deadline in short time

I’m looking for an app like that because it’s so annoying that popular todo apps
and Apple Reminders, needs to make so much taps on screen, set name, set date -
press Done, Set hour - press Done etc…  Adding a simple task takes like 45
seconds, and I could write in on paper in 5 seconds. “Write on paper then” - no
because it’s easy to loose it  I don’t need super advanced apps that you guys
use with extra task details etc.   Thank you in advance!

 Seems like you want a todo app with Natural Language Processing when adding
tasks. I could recommend these:  Todoist TickTick AmpleNote Obsidian with Tasks
plugin  The last 2 ones are more of notes apps with task management
capabilities, so they might not suit your needs.   Todoist and TickTick are task
focused apps, and both of them have widgets you can add to your phone screen.
Simply unlock, tap the add task widget button and type your task out. Ex - take
out the trash tomorrow at 9am. Shouldn't take more than 10s if you unlock the
phone on first try.  If your iPhone has IOS16, you can add a Todoist widget to
your lock screen and add a task from there and not need to unlock to add a task.
I don't know about TickTick tho. 
 
     I’ll check out Todoist first, because two people already recommended it. Thank you for your time!



 Building an app out of the same frustrations you have.  Not sure if it covers
100% your needs, but it does focus on todo + schedule.  You add task, you set
due date, that's it. You would be able to do it right on the calendar or in a
form, in a interactive way (drag and resize blocks rather than open list, select
time, close, open other list, select date, etc..).  The app is work in progress,
but if you'd like to check the landing page and sign up for the waiting list,
you can do it here: [https://timblodo.webflow.io/](https://timblodo.webflow.io/)
Also youtube videos building the project in public coming soon 
 
     I’ll check it out!

     Your ""Join Waiting List"" is broken. Just a heads up.



 To Do (from Microsoft I think) is also great 
 


 Todoist is really great, but I personally prefer TeuxDeux. 
 


 I personally tried multiple apps but at the end google calendar is the best for
me. Really simple.  The only that lacks is task duration. You can only set the
strating time of the task and not how much time it will take 
 


 Todoist 
 


 Not an app but [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) is great for this at the
command line:  task add due:today+7d homework 
 


 Try Finale To Do if you have an iPhone. Super simple and fast 
 


 The r/Taskade. Especially after they released the Task Creation Widgets. 
 


 If you're looking for something focused on quick capture and very deadline
sensitive, then Due fulfills that. I use it for time driven items (take trash to
curb - reoccurring Monday's at 6:30pm) or Call pharmacy in 20 minutes for
status. All other tasks I keep in a typical to-do app.

Struggling to Find a Viable Productivity Solution – Need Some Fresh Ideas!,"Struggling to Find a Viable Productivity Solution – Need Some Fresh Ideas!

Hey all,  I’m hoping to get some advice on my productivity setup, as I’m feeling
stuck in a sea of apps and tools without finding a real “flow.” Currently, I’m
using a bunch of different platforms like Apple Notes, Apple Files, Google
Drive, Google Docs, Evernote, Notion, Things, TickTick, and more, but each of
them comes with its own set of pros and cons. Here’s how it usually goes for me:
•       Apple Apps (Notes, Files): I feel safer with my content in Apple’s
ecosystem. I can password-protect notes, and the apps aren’t accessible through
the browser, so I’m less worried about someone accidentally accessing my stuff.
But, sharing files with non-Apple users is a pain, so I always end up back in
Google Drive.         •       Google Drive/Docs: Great for collaboration and
file sharing, but here’s where I feel more exposed. If someone borrows my
computer, they can easily access my Google files since there’s no separate login
for apps like Drive and Docs within the browser.         •       Things: My go-
to for task management because of its deadline feature and the convenience of
the iOS lock screen shortcut. But, when I need to add images to my tasks, I have
to switch to TickTick since Things doesn’t handle that well.         •
TickTick: Perfect for tasks that involve images, but it’s not as robust with
deadlines and reminders as Things.         •       Evernote: I dump a lot of
stuff here because it feels like a “catch-all” space, but over time it becomes a
cluttered mess, and I haven’t found a good tagging system that works.         •
Notion: I only really use it for its database functionality, but managing multi-
level categories and linking between databases gets confusing fast.         •
Pages/Word: I’m still undecided on which one to use for writing because I can’t
figure out the best place to store those documents (Apple Files? Google Drive?
Evernote?).  So, here I am, constantly jumping between apps without a smooth
flow. I feel like I’m spending too much time figuring out where to put things or
how to connect them.  Has anyone found a productivity system or a way to
integrate all of these tools without making a mess of it? Or maybe I’m
approaching it all wrong and need to rethink how I’m organizing everything. I’d
love to hear how others have simplified or streamlined their workflows!  Any
tips or new thinking would be much appreciated!

 I'm also in the process of simplifying. You only need one Notes app, one
Calendar, one Task Manager and one Storage.   I use different apps than you
(Obsidian, GCalendar, OneDrive and Todoist), but from what you wrote, better to
focus on Apple ecosystem. So: - Keep Apple Notes and ditch Evernote and Notion.
- Keep Things and ditch TickTick (save images on Apple Notes).  - Use Pages and
Apple Files. - Use Google Drive/docs only when you need to share to outside the
Apple Ecosystem.   Hope this helps 
 
     I like your response. What do u think of using a separate app just for sharing files?



 Hi, yeah I feel you with jumping all over the place with products. I have only
recently in the last year or so have decided on a couple platforms to stick
with. It just sounds like you to need to pick what apps work best for you and
your use case. You have a lot of overlap in app functionality.  I was a big
Evernote user until the price hike. I have tried a bunch of to do apps and have
gone back and forth on cloud storage.   I ended up using OneNote because it was
already included in my MS 365 subscription. It does like 90% of what I used
Evernote for. It took me a while to transfer 7 years of notes over, but it was
nice to go through my old notes and clear out some junk instead of just bulk
exporting. I also can access my Notes from my work computer and use my iPad to
take hand written notes during meeting.    You probably don’t need things and
TickTick . The same with notion & evernote. I would try picking one of each
category and try it out. 
 
     Thanks for your answer. Would you have stayed with Evernote if they didnt increase price?

Living the day through calendar/reminder,"Living the day through calendar/reminder

Hi,   I have decided to live my life through a reminder and a calendar. I want
to have the small things like brushing, showering, cleaning up and stuff on a
to-do type of app and I want a calendar app so that I don't miss classes or
important events. What do you guys use to organize your everyday like that? If
you use the apple calendar and the reminder app, how did you set it up?   I'm a
18 year old male turning 19 soon trying to organize my life. I lay on my bed all
day, game on the playstation I have setup in front of my bed. I only use my
MacBook on the bed and averages about 7 hours of screen time. Yes I watch videos
and game at the same time. It's been like this for about a year (I took a gap
year). I got into a university a few days ago, and I can't overcome my current
lifestyle/habit of sitting on my ass so I just skip classes subconsciously.
Thank you.

 If you can separate your bed from the workplace ( a table for example, and a
gaming place) that will probably help to get started... if possible. 
 


 Outlook mail and calendar even has built in task list. And task can be done in
separate app To-do. Then just created re-occuring events in the calendar and it
will remind you of the daily stuff.. tasks goes in to the calendar as well and
you can make lists for everything. Best thing as that all can be done in the
outlook app. Even though I prefer using the to-do app. 
 
     Outlook has built in notes aswell

"My Parents Have Screen Time on Me, How Do I Bypass it?","My Parents Have Screen Time on Me, How Do I Bypass it?

I used to just do the ""ask for one more minute on a different website and swipe
left or right"", but now since I have ios 26, it works differently for one more
minute on a Safari website. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me get at least websites
glitched, and dont tell me webloc manager, as I have that but I want to be able
to go on the app of the website, like glitching one more minute on Instagram
gives one more minute on the app. Please dont tell me random stuff like talk to
your parents, as I'm 15 and still have screen time(almost 16)

 Do you know what they are trying to accomplish with this? 
 
     ive asked them and they give me a different answer every time



 Alright so this is if adding acc are locked, health then account then health
records then get started select a hospital and then privacy policy try find a
way onto YouTube and then search google link in description then you can just
click the google link in the description and u can search whatever 
 
     idk how this trick has never been brought up before thank you!!

     What hospital are you using to find the links?

     smart af thanks bro yea my mail accs got locked too



 If you are 15 and still have screen time limits there are usually reasons for
it. 
 
     Not really, some parents are just controlling

     To be overly controlling over your teens life because you weren't responsible enough to control your own.
    Not a great reason



 Maybe ask about the removal instead of trying to bypass it?  Edit to add:
possible outcome of trying to remove it the parentals double down on your
internet access. 
 
     yes true but atp idrc



 I have them still at same age but they are mostly just a hassle 
 
     well u prob have more time tbf



 I HAVE TO ADD: IM ALSO DOING THIS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT COMPUTERS AND HACKING, and
my dad does computers so hell prob drop it if i do smth smart. im not some
delinquent kid that watches yt shorts all day. 
 


 I don't understand why you can't just talk to your parents but it's behavior
like this that makes them be so controlling with your screen time. Making posts
asking how you can break the rules is a great way to get banned from screens all
together. 
 
     i understand wym but sometimes theres no way out but that



 dude , i suggest you take free online   cell phone classes to learn hacking 
 
     yea i might start



 whats different? havent tried anythings related to screentime after getting ios
26 
 


 Hiiii so my phone hasn't been updated since a LOOOOONG time like rn i'm on IOS
18.6 ig (since they say i can update to IOS 18.7) and you say there is a way
with the ask for one more minute to glitch your app limit so do you think it
will work for me ? (not fluent in english i'm french)

PSA: Screen Time passcode usage will now send notifications,"PSA: Screen Time passcode usage will now send notifications

With the latest iOS beta, (iOS 18.5 RC) using the screen time passcode on a
child device will send a notification to the parents/guardians. Unless you're on
the beta right now, this won't effect you until the update is officially
released most likely next Monday. Not updating to iOS 18.5 will make it not send
notifications to your parents, but I wouldn't recommend it. Just thought I'd let
everyone know! Stay safe!

 I have the beta and now I can't do any of my loopholes anymore because my
parents instantly know and just lock every app on my phone including camera 
 
     try to do it when they're asleep. Quickly do it and then steal their phones to delete the notifications.

     this is a late reply, but as long as you have your parents phone unlocked, you can go to settings, then
    click yourself on the family part, then scroll till you see the icon with the green lock (i forgot what
    it’s called) and there should be a option to turn off notifications for your parents so it won’t send
    anything about entering the passcode



 [removed] 
 
     If my parents have 18.5 and I don’t update will they still get the notification?



 Thank god I don’t have this anymore, I found out the password so I could just
type it into everything… 
 
     same, found it years ago and have had no problems

     im confused, do you parents not have a notification?



 I’m happy on iOS 18.2 
 


 i found this out the hard way 💔 
 
     Same 🥀🥀🥀

     Same 😞😞 (I used to know the password and because of this damn update they found out and changed it 💔💔

 The more I see these posts, the more I'm glad my parents only used parental
controls for me back when the device I was using only had useless parental
control options.  I hope you'll be free from it soon. Or if not, I hope you find
a good bypass for that. 💪

Screen Time passcode from 4 years ago is blocking iCloud — mom forgot it,"Screen Time passcode from 4 years ago is blocking iCloud — mom forgot it

Hey guys, so when I was 14 my mom set up a Screen Time passcode on my phone and
chose “don’t allow account changes.” Because of that, I’ve basically been locked
out of my iCloud ever since — can’t sign in, sign out, or do anything with it.
I’m 18 now and it’s super frustrating because all my backups and stuff are on
there and I really don’t want to lose everything. Is there anything I can do to
fix this? Any help would be amazing.

 She should be able to remove the passcode using her Apple ID. It is essentially
the admin password to your account. If she forgets what that ID and Password is
she can do a recovery using her backup email/phone number or another Apple
device. 
 
     she doesn’t have an Apple ID because she has an android so i honestly don’t know what she used to set the
    passcode🤦‍♂️ I’m probably just gonna have to contact Apple



 I would take your mom to Apple and the two of yall hash it out with them.
They’ll bend over backwards to fix stuff usually 
 
     Probably what I’m gonna have to do



 there’s programs you can use to fix this btw, broque ramdisk on windows is one 
 


 honestly idk why I’m getting downvoted?😭 god forbid someone doesn’t want rude
and condescending comments when they’re already frustrated. If you don’t want to
help that’s totally okay 
 
     okay so ill see if I can help u or not, what ios version are you using



 There is a brute forcing method. Go settings > general > Transfer or Reset
iPhone > Erase All Content and Settings. You need to press continue, enter your
password, then it will prompt you for the Screen Time passcode. There is no
entry limit here, so, you just have to type in codes until you reach the correct
password, then make sure to cancel when you get it. You should probably try
other methods first because this is risky if you accidentally confirm the erase. 
 
     gonna try this, thank you!

     ill remember this



 is it thru family sharing or js ur phone? either way wont the phones password
disable it? 
 
     So not exactly because it requires its own password and she unfortunately forgot that but it’s not through
    family sharing! just directly put on this device



 3uTools has a feature that let's you get the screen time code 
 


 Your mom can just reset the passcode… or you can do it if she gives you her
phone. 
 


 Call apple, speak to a person. They should get you a set up with minimal effort. 
 


 She will have to call apple and get them to reset it. If she doesnt do that,
you're SOL.

Bypass screen time,"Bypass screen time

Hello. for some context, my parents prohibit social media in my house.
Previously i had this phone monitoring app called bark. Eventually we moved onto
apple family screen time. I knew the passcode, so i got these apps and turned it
all off. Cut forward to saturday, my parents found out. They deleted all the
apps and put a 0 hour 0 minute limit on them, and then changed the password. I
really want to use the discord app, to talk to my friends, but its under the
time limit. I dont know the code, and i am on ios 18.4. Is there anyway i can
bypass this limit. Thank you

 you should just get your friends’ phone numbers 
 
     online friends



 You can use discord as a website, not just an app. 
 


 Gonna have to find out that password :/  Apple doesn’t really play with allowing
bypasses like that 
 


 You could try using the browser version on a computer (library computer?) 
 


 If you need only web, settings is unlocked (it probably is because u cant block
it i believe), go to settings, apps, mail click on mail accounts then add
account, click google, then click help, and type or find in the results 'search
on google', find and click the redirect to google, then if u want to go to dc
search for discord.com/app and log in (the ui looks a little weird and you have
to log in every time but its worth it) 
 


 Consider changing your time in General>Date and time in settings, or looking at
other posts. I’ll link you one if I can when I find it 
 
     yeah i mean the changing the time is blocked and even if it wasnt i dont think it could help if its under
    a 0 hour time limit



 Yes their is I’m 16 with a screen time as well all you need to to is go to
“Assesibiltily” in settings and then click on “Assisitive Ascess “ then it will
prompt you to enter the screen time password but if you notice on the bottom of
the screen it will say something along the lines of “ Use a new passcode” or
something like that so what you do is click on enter screen time passcode and
then when on the number keyboard screen you click above it on that white bar and
it will change the screen allowing you to assess a new code for assisitive
acess. Then just add the apps you want. Sorry for my ability to spell lol. 
 
     wait what i domt really understand 



 Js a question do u have access to a laptop 
 
     Uhmm yes

 Try to screen record them typing the password Just use a 3rd party one, or just

How do I override ScreenTime on iOS?,"How do I override ScreenTime on iOS?

I have 18.5 so I can't enter the ScreenTime password without my parents knowing,
my parents are pretty tech savvy so that's a problem, my parents monitor my
activity once an hour, and I can't do anything in settings due to screen time
restrictions. I'm a 14 yr old sophomore in high school and they still treat me
like I'm 9, I have an obsession with F1 and I can't even do anything related to
F1. I understand that they want me to succeed but I also want freedom sometimes
instead of my phone being locked to the point where I can't even use my camera
just because I didn't put my dog's toys away or something. Please help.

 tbh ik this isn’t the answer people want to hear but you can’t bypass it easily
at all. Unlike an external app like norton or bark the default IOS screen time
limits are way too deeply integrated with the software.   You mentioned earlier
you can get a job soon. my only advice for you is buy a burner phone that
doesn’t have those limits.    I had to deal with screen time too a year ago it
was when i turned 16 when my parents finally stopped using it. it’s just one of
those things that you can’t get through easily at all

     That's always the most functional answer. The built-in parental controls are just too deeply integrated in
    most cases.

     Be careful with that, if their controls are super strict, some networks can show what devices are
    operating or if any new devices connect. I had a wifi network in the past that let's you see what devices
    are on and when they were activated. Which was pretty fucked up tbh. Not sure why that was a home feature
    but I can see overbearing parents utilizing that to their advantage.



 Danng I had the same issue but just backup the phone using itunes and reset the
phone and add new icloud account and restore. My parents didn't knew for months 
 
     Problem is they would know immediately 



 > I'm a 14 yr old sophomore in high school and they still treat me like I'm 9, 
Sounds like they treat you like a 14 year old.  If they feel like they need to
check every hour, they're treating you like a 14 year old who has earned a
reputation for trying to circumvent restrictions.  Here you are proving that
reputation is true.  Trust that you will be much better off trying to operate as
an honest and trustworthy person than someone who's clever enough to get around
the rules. 
 
     bold of you to make so many wild assumptions. reads like a parent trying to justify doing this to their
    own child, who mayyyyybe went low/nc with them because of it. i dunno ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

     I didn’t put one of the dogs toys away and they came to my campus to take my phone, if that’s not strict
    idk what is



 Restore your iPhone using iTunes and create a new Apple ID 
 


 I have a mobile config file u can use to stop this. U will need a laptop tho
(windows or Mac work) to make ur device work. DM me for details, I can hop on
discord or whatever if u want a tutorial. 
 
     Hey bro can you just tell me the steps kinda specificly I think I can get there myself 

     yo could you tell me too pls ill be eternally grateful 



 ur 14 as a soph?? wtf im 15 as a freshman. got no clue how to help tho 
 


 I’m 13 my parents have the same thing for me. I used to use a FaceTime trick but
Apple fixed it in the new update so I’m kinda fucked. Anyone got a glitch?  
 
     Same i dont know man



 Not sure if it still works but if you click “One more minute” from 12-6Am it
unlocks the app for the whole day until 12Am the next day. Once again haven't
used this since like December but its worth a shot to try it. 
 


 Here are some tips       1. You can change the time on your phone to another
time zone, this should work  2. If you know your moms or dads password to their
phone, hold the notification when asking for more time after unlocking her
phone, then you’ll get to choose between 15 min, 1 hour or 24 hours  3. you can
try to guess the password  4. you can reset the phone but it’s unethical

iOS 26 - Huge changes coming to Screen Time,"iOS 26 - Huge changes coming to Screen Time

Hello everyone! I'm that one beta tester who's made a few posts about upcoming
changes to Screen Time. The iOS 26 Developer Beta came out a little over two
weeks ago, and I've been testing it since day one.  I've found a couple of big
changes related to Screen Time, and I thought I'd share them here to warn anyone
who uses these.  First, One More Minute usage has completely changed, and I'm
not sure exactly how it works yet. Using One More Minute on an app allows all
apps for one minute, and every Downtime session only some apps have One More
Minute available. For example, one night Apple TV might have One More Minute
available, but the next time it doesn't. I thought this was a bug, so I reported
it to Apple but they marked my report as ""Investigation complete - Works as
currently designed"" This means this weird setup will most likely make it to the
official release in September.  Second, custom in-app browsers are not included
in Screen Time, meaning Downtime shuts them off, and app limits apply. I
previously used the Bible app's built-in browser, but Downtime shuts it off now.
Surprisingly, the web browser in Settings > Mail > Accounts > Add Account >
Google > Privacy > Nine dots still works!  I know this is long, but hopefully
someone finds these useful! Let me know if you want me to test anything in iOS
26 related or unrelated to Screen Time. Also feel free to ask any questions!

 Do you know how to Bypass some of These 
 
     I haven’t found any bypasses yet, but I’ll let you know if I do! The one I mentioned in the post is the
    web browser in Settings, which is technically a bypass.



 Can you please confirm that in app browsers now show up as “chrome” “google” or
“safari” on 26? I’ve heard some rumors that all the browser exploits will show
up as the browser and not the app it’s in 
 
     I just ran the in-app browser in the Bible app, and it showed up as Bible in Screen Time. Is this what
    you’re asking for?

     i have seen differently, i have it and it shows time on every website you use even in the in app browser..
    i’ve found a way in pinterest, and in my screen time it shows pinterest time AND the time i spent on the
    website 

     I used the Pinterest browser to bypass, but this no longer works in ios 26, if anyone has any advice
    please let me know.



 i agree! i have been testing since day one too, and i found out the answer to a
few of these   For the “One more minute” it is not per app any more, when you
use one more minute, in unlocks all apps for one minute and then your one more
minute will not come back, so use your one more minute wisely   the in app
browsers, yes are also shut down… but… another warning… any website you go to is
logged in screen time.. so if you were on reddit, it would show time that you
spent on reddit in your screen time, even if you were using an in app browser
hope this helps! 
 
     I wonder if One More Minute is still broken then? For me, after using it it’ll use it on all of my apps
    but like last night eBay had an extra One More Minute while all the others didn’t.



 If you use the settings method, does it show in screentime as settings still or
does it show the individual websites. 
 
     Thankfully only shows as Settings!



 I had screetime on for some settings and now 16 of my apps are missing. Only way
to get them back is turnoff screentime. Utter mess 
 
     It’s an age restriction issue! If you go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > App
    Store, Media, Web, & Games and change Apps to something higher (like 18+) it should fix your issue!



 Hi! I have the problem now where I want to be able to access those browsers if I
have downtime. This was my problem: Before downloading iOS 26 public beta, I
could use the Chrome App and Browser normally, also if I had downtime (because
Chrome was (and still is) in my ""Always Allowed"" Apps). Now, I have limit for
all websites. Is there any way to turn this off (so that it works like before)? 
 
     You’d have to allow all websites in Downtime settings now

     If you use the Chrome app and search using Incognito, you can bypass the screen time restrictions. The
    thing is you can only type in links, and if your parents have limit adult websites on, searching those
    links won't work. If it says that it's still restricted or restricts when you switch to a different link
    close the app then reopen it.



 Can you please explain to me how to get to the nine dots part? I press the
privacy and it takes me to apple website i dont know what to do from there 
 
     Ah, ok so you actually went to the wrong website. When you’re on the list of email services, select
    Google. Then, privacy. There should be nine dots in the top right of your screen!



 In Screen Time, the toggle to allow apps with Screen Time access is still only
protected by Face ID in iOS 18, rendering all third-party screen time apps
useless. Has Apple changed this?   Also, does Downtime still completely block
all websites in Safari? 
 
     These are my two biggest gripes with Screen Time



 what do you mean by 9 dots in the bypass?? 
 
     Settings > Apps > Mail > Mail Accounts > Add Account > click “choose from a list.” > Google > Open Browser
    > click “Privacy” at the bottom > click the nine dots at the top right (3x3 square of dots, next to the
    Sign in button) > Search



 How do I set app limits? 
 
"
How do I get my strict parents to give me more screen time?,"How do I get my strict parents to give me more screen time?

I’m 16 and my parents have really strict screen time limits. My phone locks
early and most apps are blocked. I feel like it’s too much now and it’s making
it hard to stay in touch with friends and do school stuff.  I don’t want to
sneak around — I just want to talk to them in a way that won’t start a fight.
Any tips on how to ask for more time calmly and responsibly?

 Two questions:     Have you asked them what you can do to earn more screen time?
Have you done anything in the past to break their trust regarding internet
usage? 
 
     Standard /r/parentalcontrols framing.  First the reversed burden of proof. By default, in any sane system
    of ethics or norms, everybody, including even very young children, is free to do whatever they want unless
    there's a reason to the contrary. One does not *earn* screen time or any other use of their time. One may
    *lose* it, but only for a good reason. Although it's a bad idea to bring it up with people who have
    authoritarian worldviews, the burden is in fact on the person who wants more restriction, not on the
    person who wants less.  Then the obligatory insinuation that the person asking is probably to blame for
    the whole situation.

     screen time is not something to be earned  especially if used for self-development  and absolutely not if
    it is necessary to fultil an obligation (as that meets the definition of setting up to fail via a no-win
    scenario, which cause is negligance  or purpuseful action of other persons and not affected person)



 What are their stated reasons? What are their concerns? Do you *know*, or do you
just *think* you know? *How* do you know?  Usually negotiating with people is a
matter of:  1. Being calm and reasonable. 2. Not putting them on the defensive.
3. Not making them think you're trying to put one over on them. 4. Showing that
you understand their concerns, and making them feel like you actually *care*
about their concerns. 5. Making them believe you're actually trying to work with
them to address as many of possible of theirs *and* yours. By far the best way
to make them believe that that is to actually *do* it, and do it visibly. 6.
When you run into a case where you *can't* both be satisfied, having a good
feeling for what you can trade for what. In your case, you hold the weak hand,
so you have to be careful about what you get in exchange for anything you give
up, and even so you may not be able to get much. On the other hand, you'll be
tempted to offer trades that insult them, which poisons the rest of the
negotiation.  Remember that if you promise to do anything you wouldn't already
have had to do anyway, that's a concession. In a just world you could ask for a
concession in exchange. But in the unjust world we actually live in, a lot of
parents will tend to think that anything that comes into their minds *should*
already be something you ""have to do"", and be insulted and even retaliatory if
you don't also immediately buy into that.  So you may not be able to trade much
at all. A possible pattern is to get them to decide and agree that you shouldn't
have to do X, *then* offer to do X in trade for something else. But honestly
you're likely going to have very little room to trade without putting them on
the defensive.  If you come up with a creative, but somewhat complicated,
solution to a conflict, pause a second and make sure you explain it in a way
that doesn't make it sound threatening. If it involves accepting something
that's going to sound weird or risky to them, then leave that part until *after*
you've explained any parts that would make them feel it was *less* weird or
risky.  Some people can't be negotiated with, though. If their true goal is just
to demonstrate their Authority, or if they're unwilling or unable to see you as
rational or as somebody they *should* negotiate with, you're not going to get
anywhere. 
 


 Where it affects school, and is not your fault (you prioritze use for school) -
fail that and work around it. Treat the result as a consquence, not a
punishment. Now you can blame your parents claiming it is a no-win
scenario/setting up to fail. If that is too risky trat that as a contributing
factor and take most of the blame. It's hard to argue somebody is at fault for
being set up to fail via a no-win scenario unless they have taken part in
setting it up purposefully or due to negligence.  Replace procedures using
technology with ones that don't. Especially if they happen to create niusance. 
 


 First, you need to prove that you have learned to control yourself and that you
won't spend hours on social media and games. 
 
     Everybody wants to do that, it's basic priorities, games are not the enemy here 💀🙏



 If they are authoritarian, while I explain, start booking them their trip to the
nursing home in 40 years, iPhone only: Put that thing in DFU mode, then restore
it with iTunes. 
 


 So you have all A's for grades? If not, start there.

"parents keep getting notifications when i use the screen time passcode, how to turn it off?","parents keep getting notifications when i use the screen time passcode, how to turn it off?

they aren’t told whether i did it right or wrong, they assume i did it wrong and
im trying to guess the password. (i did it right, i know it lol)   how can i
turn it off? on my phone there’s nothing, is there a button to disable it on
their phone?   **EDIT:** I figured it out.   what you need to do is turn off
your wifi, bluetooth(i did, probably not required) and CELLULAR DATA. all the
way off, go to settings to turn off your phone number SMS card (do not remove
it).   you know you are in the clear if you send a message to someone on
imessage and it doesn’t go through.   then, put it in the password like normal.
**but REMEMBER DO NOT PUT UR CELLUAR BACK ON UNTIL ITS COMPLETELY DONE GIVING
YOU YOUR TIME BACK.**  I would wait a few minutes to be sure, because i had my
parents yell at me once and the only reason they found out was because i put the
cellular on too quickly and the notification went through.   phones are a bit
weird, but i do wait until the app turns dark (downtime) to light again.
(uptime? idk)    **THIS ISNT COMPLETELY RELIABLE, BUT IT DOES WORK MOST OF THE
TIME. TO BE SAFE MAKE SURE TO:**  - turn off ur sms line in SETTINGS /cellular
/turn on this line (AT&T, idk about others)   - wait at LEAST 5 minutes to be
sure. (should say SOS)   - have a back up plan! if ur guardian asks what you
were doing, have an excuse already prepped!   - don’t forget to be safe!

 Tell your parents your fucking old enough to not have them 
 
     fair enough 🤔

     I wish 😭🙏

     How old?



 you sound like you're about to lose your privileges fyi 
 
     yeah i think i figured out around it, scared me tho lol. i still got my phone so ig im good.



 yeah if you go to settings on their phone, there’s a feature to turn the notif
off 
 
     Is this true, like actually?

     what  is it omg



 I found a method that works but be careful since they can still look at the
charts from screentime on their end. Turn off all wifi and Cellular on YOUR
device then put in the code for whatever. The notification cannot send since you
have no connection. 
 
     have u tested this? it sounds legit but i wanted to ask before i risk anything.

     I would also like to know if this works



 [deleted] 
 
     Nope, they could still take it and restrict it legally. Anyways, it’s likely OP can’t anyways because
    their parents wouldn’t approve or have restricted the means to or both. Also victim blaming.



 perchance could you estimate the amount of time I should wait? 
 
     i wait until the app turns from dark to light again. (i’ll add that to my post)



 is this confirmed to work? also what do u mean when u say giving ur time back?
has anyone tried this where you actually change the settings instead of just
giving yourself more time? 
 
     im trying to add tiktok to always allowed

     ah sorry, i use the term “giving back your time” when you are no longer on downtime.   yes! i have i do it
    often. if your worried id just wait like 5 minutes.   also, i wouldn’t put it on always allow. if i were
    you i wouldn’t put go to the actual app limit (if u have one) and turn off the “block at screen limit”
    option. that way you can just add more time without the password or the notification.   if you do it this
    way you can feign innocence much easier.



 my parents keep getting notified and idk why cuz I did all the steps but it
seems like they’re only notified sometimes?? Does anyone know why?? TwT 
 
     yeah same... did u figure this out??



 does this still work for ios18.5? (gonna try anyways lol) 
 
     i believe so yes



 This is two months later and I think im on a more recent version (I think 18.6).
Does this still work? 
 
     can’t find any change notes in the update log. i’m also fully updated and i haven’t gotten in trouble
    while using the method described above. i used it this morning and was just fine.

How do I get access to the internet despite screen time control? IOs,"How do I get access to the internet despite screen time control? IOs

Hii I'm 15 and looking for any method to have unlimited access on websites since
I have 5 minutes of screen time on my device daily. First of all I can't
download any new apps since I need to ask my parent to download anything. I've
already used internet through pinterest and ibispaintX but my dad locked those
apps as well. Recently I started using the IOs settings method
(settings>Mail>mail accounts>add account>help>search 'search google'>click the
link) but by dad found out about it and locked this feature as well💔. I searched
through many posts and still can't find any new way to get internet access. If
anyone has their own methods then I would be glad if you shared those in the
comments, thanks!! >\_< (Sorry for any grammar mistakes but english isn't my
first language :3)     (Edit) Okay. After a little while I did manage to get the
webocular shortcut app and it's working so far. Big thanks to everyone, who
shared tips! ( \^ω\^ )

 Honestly it's getting ridiculous. He even locked the calculator app lol 
 


 The real question is what the FUCK did you do for your parents to restrict your
screen time to FIVE MINUTES?!!? 
 
     You’ll find out half the answer tomorrow when he gets 5 minutes again 😂



 If you keep finding loopholes, they’re going to end up just taking your device. 
 
     Eh, I have no illusions that I will be able to restrict my kids.   When I was 10, my parents took my TV
    away, I found an old Black and White TV in the basement, and hooked it up in the closet, they never found
    it.   When they took my internet away, I stopped sleeping at night, and dialed up into AOL.   This list
    goes on and on. I acquired a laptop when they caught me doing that, in 2001, at 12, with no money.   Kids
    are fucking smart. Restrictions don't work. Being open and honest does.

     Not if they don’t let them

     5 minutes is almost the same as no access at all so I'd rather try to get more time than just sit here and
    hope for the better

     I know but there's not much I can do since as I said, I only get 5 mins of access per day🥀🥀



 You might have to ask dad to enable/disable something in the parental controls
settings, and then watch him enter the parental controls code (if you want to
change the parental controls settings later, write the code somewhere. (You can
use your iPhone to save the code as well, but your dad might find it and change
the parental controls code, so do this at your own risk)). That's the only
method I can think of. 
 
     Best to record with any scratch phone externally because screen recording a passcode entry won’t work 



 If you can get the reading app Libby and get a book on there you can highlight a
word, click define, then search google 
 
     what if I have a time limit for google?



 Did he say why he is limited  it to 5 minutes 
 
     Yes 5 minutes, that's basically nothing anyway



 maybe if you stopped trying to use loopholes and showed your parents some
respect you'll get some screen time back 
 
     Grandpa stop posting on a 15 year olds Reddit post you bastard.

iOS screen time bypass,"iOS screen time bypass

Step 1: when you have run out of screen time on your phone or iPad, go to
settings>general>language and region>region, and change your region to another
country.  Step 2: Leave the settings app and use any app that you want. After
about 2 minutes, it will say your time is up. When you see this turn your device
off (don’t power it off, just press the off button). Leave the device for about
20-30 seconds and then turn it on and unlock it. This should double your screen
time for the day. If it doesn’t work first time, try again with your original
region. I hope this helps, if not, ask a question or DM me about it and I will
try to help as best as I can.

     I have had this before, and I have no idea tbh.



 can you help me? im in Aus and when i change the region to canada, i only get
about 1 minute then it turns off again.  screen time hours are 7am to 5:30pm
bruh 
 
     Hi, after your screen time kicks in after that one minute, turn your phone off, wait about 20-30 seconds,
    and then turn it on. if it doeesnt work, try a different region, Hope this helps!

     Did you manage to figure it out I’m also in Aus. I tried step by step didn’t work just went to screen
    time 

     Are you on IOS 18 or 17? Because it only works in IOS 17. If you are on IOS 17, try changing the region
    back to Australia and then repeating the process

     Same



 does this work even if you do it in downtime? like after the bedtime or does it
only work if you have finished the screentime 
 
     Doesn’t work after downtime



 My parents will see the screen time being more than yhe limit, what do i do 
 
     If you only need to bypass limits on websites, go to the link and then download the shortcut. Once you run
    it, you can use it to bypass limits for websites and it won’t show up on screen time.[Go to this
    link](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/20356/)



 Bruh so this don’t work in iOS 18  
 
     No it doesn’t srry



 Thank you so much but the sound is gone on the apps that have a limit: iPhone SE 
 
     What I do is usually just keep changing the regions until the sound turns on I skip the second step that
    this dude posted and keep switicing it until it works



 THANK YOU ILYSM 
 


 js so yk, you can also change your current time under Settings>General>Date&Time
to some time after/before downtime, or after your app limits reset for the next
day, and use all the apps you want. 
 
     Yeah, but most people have iPhones that are on a later iOS, and dont support that, but it is a good tip

     It doesn’t work if you have the time auto set to where you are

 For anyone wondering, this is what this user sent me: In order to remove screen
time on a iPhone without parent permission you need a computer with windows,

cowabunga lite (the app is a little sketchy but as long you fully uninstall

Settings>Privacy and Security>Stolen Device Protection>Off>Back to Privacy and

Then click on code then download zip. Open your files app and open the file.
There should be prompt that shows up. Open Settings>General>VPN And Device

I'm 16, and my mother is being a control freak, and there has been a screentime
downtime from 9 p.m. until 7 a.m. It's really annoying because I cannot use my
phone at all. Could someone help me bypass this or at least get the passcode
somehow? It's an iPhone 11, and I have a PC to sideload stuff on. I had a method
of getting past it, but my phone automatically updated, and it doesn't work
anymore. My current IOS is 18.5. Thanks if anyone could help.

 No matter how you do it. Your parents will find out, and then what privileges
you have when it comes to screen time, will be gone. 
 
     Literally. 9pm is plenty of time to use your phone and then be off of it. You don’t need it later than
    that. If they find out you screwed with it, you won’t have a phone anymore.  Your parents bought the
    phone, they pay for it and the phone plan, you have to follow their rules



 Restore the iPhone using iTunes and create a new Apple ID 
 


 If you have a Mac you can use Nugget to enable supervision and then install a
profile to block screen time, to unblock/block you just remove/install the
profile. The profile won’t work unless you first enable supervision in Nugget on
Mac 
 
     sorry for the late response, does it have to be a mac, I got a windows PC, could I do it on iTunes or
    something?



  I’m going to be honest, this sounds reasonable. Maybe ask for an extension by
an hour or two for Fridays and Saturdays while in school, or an hour or two
during breaks.  If you’re in school, 7am to 9pm being able to use your phone is
plenty of time to have access, use for homework, and be able to settle down
before bed. Find something to do an hour before bed that isn’t looking at a
screen.   If your mom was a control freak, she would lock your phone down until
you were released from school.

 i have the same thing except i have until 11pm but the only things is i have a
total of just 30 minutes every single day for all of my socials… i could listen
to music for 10 minutes, be on google maps for 10, and play games for another 10
and pretty much all of mg apps shut down besides messages and calls. at 11pm
everything shuts down besides the clock app. it’s so irritating and my mom is
constantly changing my passcode and i’ve tried to negotiate with her but she
legit doesn’t listen. I have an iPhone 14 and i just updated my phone the other
day. i also need help please 
 


 Tbh ur lucky. I have only 1 min per day 😭if it wasn’t bc of Duolingo which I use
to bypass time through logging in with google then I wouldn’t be able to use my
phone at all. My step-dad put me only one min on my phone bc at the time I had
an F on a class but by the time the quarter was over I had a B. I’ve never
failed any class b4 and I passed my final Algebra test and it’s summer like it’s
so unfair. :( if anything ur very blessed  
 


 Honestly, this is reasonable at your age.  When I was 16, 9 PM was my
bedtime...teenagers need a lot of sleep. 
 
     listen they're gonna  have a crazy sleep schedule as some point better to have it in their teen years

     Not so early.   It's been proven teens favor sleeping later and waking up later than adults or children.
    Needing a lot of sleep isn't an excuse. Most people communicate and have free time after or around 9 PM.
    She is a control freak, with or without a reason, but still a freak.

     Who has a bedtime past 11? I was out later at like 11-12 at 12 years old let alone 16 😂

Please help; screen time restrictions,"Please help; screen time restrictions

So my parents are super strict, they put lots of limits on my phone- I’m looking
for a way to work around app limits and such.  I don’t wanna hear nothing like
talk to your parents. You wouldn’t understand but they hate me.  I’m happy to
answer what restrictions / stuff they have if it helps let you know what to do.
Looking for stuff such as settings like accessibility stuff that lets you access
apps with a time limit  Thanks so much!!!!!   Edit:  on ios 18.5 device iphone
13

 i think the best way is to downgrade to ios 18.4 how do i do thsi 
 
     bump

     go to reset everything in settings, it will ask for your iphone passcode then screen time passcode. here
    you have unlimited passcode attempts, and once you get the right one you can click cancel.

Method to disguise apps in MacOS and hide them from Screen Time,"Method to disguise apps in MacOS and hide them from Screen Time

Just discovered a new way to bypass screen time reporting in MacOS and cloak
apps in a different name and icon in Mac (spoiler, ITS SO STUPIDLY SIMPLE!!!).
Anyone who requires this stuff, please suggest a means of communication, because
I am worried that if it goes public, it will be patched.  This setup works even
with third party parental control apps that block websites. My config allows me
to use only Safari, and Kaspersky Safe Kids blocks certain websites. I found a
way to visit the sites using a dev tool, but since it was still safari, it
reported my activity to screen time. This does not happen for other browsers,
but using them will make them show up on screen time. This technique bypasses
that and hides app usage. It disguises the app and fools the OS into thinking it
is Safari (or whatever app u want it to be!). Chances are that this wont get
patched, and will have workarounds even if it is. Still wanna be careful tho, so
not posting out in the open.  Edit: Have decided to just show it  Here's how to
do this.  First, get your app as a DMG or as an installer. Extract the app from
there(This is basic in DMGs, just drag and drop the app into downloads or
something, your choice). If you have a PKG installer, look it up on the
internet. It's a bit of a pain.  Next, open the contents of the app(right click
and show contents) and navigate to info.plist. This is the file that needs to be
edited. Open it in TextEdit or in Nano(terminal). From there, search for the
CFBundleIndentifier and CFBundleName. Change these to com.apple.Safari(or any
other app's identifier that you want) and Safari(or other app name)
respectively. Save and exit.  Open terminal and remove your app from quarantine
with  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/program.app  And then codesign in
with the following  codesign --remove-signature /path/to/program.app  codesign
-s - --deep --force /path/to/program.app  And now to prevent anyone from seeing
it,  chflags hidden /path/to/program.app  Use Shift+Cmd+Period to see these
hidden apps.  Thats it, youre done!  Edit 2 -   Sometimes you need to add
<key>CFBundleSupportedPlatforms</key>    <array>  <string>MacOSX</string>
</array>  to info.plist to troubleshoot ""You cannot use this version of this app
with this version of MacOS""  Edit 3- Sometimes you have to change the
CFBundleSignature tag from whatever has been written there to this thing - ???
Only then will the codesign work. This is rare, but you know what to try if
things go wrong.

 so do people have to dm you or smth? 
 
     probably

     Ya know what? Forget it imma post out in the open



 watch it be a basic feature of Mac OS, after all this exists in Windows   matter
of fact just change some code & you're golden (gl decompiling things that aren't
open source though lol)  wth is ""a dev tool"", do you mean iframes? 
 
     Thats right! I never got this info online, so I decided to put it up. But what decompiling r u talking
    about? If thats another workaround, please share it here! My ""dev tool"" wasnt really a dev tool, it was
    Safari Technology Preview.



 have you tried using windows like a normal person? 
 
     My parents make me use mac due to the security controls on MacOS



 OP, this is a neat trick.   If you think it might be an actual bug or security
vulnerability, you should review some of the apple docs, make sure you don't see
what you're doing in there listed as a feature.
[httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/screentimeapidocumentation
[Httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/ManagedSettings
[Httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/familycontrols/
[Httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/deviceactivity/
[Httpswww]support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-is-screen-time-mchlfb0b5864/mac
If a skim through their docs doesn't appear to show what you're doing as an
available feature then consider whether you might like to submit it as a bug
bounty. Bug bounties are programs where a tech vendor will pay out for finding
vulnerabilities in their products. security.apple.com/bounty/  Also you might
have a mind for hacking or penetration testing. You should consider that as you
grow. 
 
     Thats really nice of you! Thanks! I'll mull over it for a while before I decide whether to submit or not.
    But man, its heartening that there are good people on the internet who will not steal ideas! Hats off to
    you!



 is this still working? i tried to do this but only got that I can't use the app
with my version of macOS 
 
     thats a codesignature thing

     fix it by editing the signature id in the app to ??? and then resign in yourself



 will this affect the app that you’re disguising it as? for example you are
changing the app identifier to safari, so will the actual safari app be affected
in any way? 
 
     The functioning won’t be, but whatever screen time you spend on that app may or may not be redirected to
    safari in screen time. I’m not sure about this, because most of the time whatever time I spend on that app
    just goes into a grey bar and doesn’t identify as any app’s screen time. Worst case scenario, screen time
    is redirected that’s it



 does this still work?  when i do codesign -s --deep --force /path/to/program.app
it says "" --deep no identity found"" 
 
     which version of MacOS r u on? cuz the command still works on mine. try something like replacing the order
    of --deep --force to --force --deep. I just looked it up, and --deep is apparently deprecated, has been
    since macOS 13. It is still in macOS, but run the command    man codesign   and see if a --deep entry
    shows up



 When I try to input the xattr command it says no such file 
 
     Specifically there’s so such file for path/to/program



 help i didd this for turning roblox into arc(my browser) and now arc is showing
up as roblox instead of the other way?? pls help. 
 
     What did you do? Did you edit the info.plist file of Arc or Roblox?

side you are teaching your kids to not give up to keep trying on a work around
and the success of hard work doing something they love which are real word gifts
to help them in life 
 
     Exactly!



 Yikes! That’s a sneaky move 😅 I get why it’s frustrating. Sounds like your kid’s
outsmarting the system, so regular screen time controls aren’t enough. You might
want to lock settings tighter or try **ikeymonitor**—I use it to catch these
little tricks before they happen. 
 


 If software limits dont work impose physical limits. 
 
     Hell naw. are you trying to ruin a poor kids life?



 This sub is for kids subverting their parental controls. Not advice for parents.

is why they should stay off their phones.   You're kid knows the phones

iOS screen time frustration,"iOS screen time frustration

We have screen time limits set for my kid but somehow this kid is on Snapchat
for 5 hours a day and I don’t understand how it’s happening. Is there any point
to apple screen time? It is a joke.

 You probably missed the block at end of time toggle. There's one at downtime and
another for app limits. Bring the query to r/Parenting 
 


 Make sure iOS is updated. Find the setting that disables installation of apps.
Change the Screen Time pin code and never type in the pin code on your kids
device. 
 


 Tell your kid that if he/she continues to not respect screen time rules, you’ll
change it so the kid only gets x amount of data on the cell plan. 
 


 Just as a head up, this sub is mainly kids looking to subvert parental controls
and they will likely just jump on you for asking.   To answer, there are a
couple of ways for your kids to get around it, but we would really need to know
the entire set up to be able to answer you completely. The apple screen time
function has some good uses, but no app is going to be foolproof.   Try the
search function on this sub instead of a post, it might help and you can get a
better understanding of what the kids are doing to breakthrough. Also understand
that being able to truly monitor and lockdown use is basically a part to full
time job in and of itself. You will not be able to simply set one app and have
it do most of the work. You’ll need to be actively monitoring your end *and* the
device being restricted. 
 
     Thanks for your response and suggestions. And lol yes I saw the ratio of parent/ kid posts. If kids I
    don’t know jump on me for asking I will shake my fist at the sky and rail against the young people these
    days.

 Wrong sub but what kid is spending 5 hours a day on Snapchat 😭 Snapchat is NOT
that exiting 
 


 iPhone has a glitch where even after the screentime runs out and u can’t use
apps anymore, it continues to run in the background for some reason. For example
I have a one hour YouTube limit and I’ve never tried to circumvent it but I’d be
getting like more than two hours on it

 I've just found a third party screen time app and it's waaaay better than Apples
joke... I think it's unique as it gets a reward system if you want to... the kid
needs to complete some learning apps in order to unlock their reward apps... I
find it a creative idea though and incentivize the kids to do smthg useful with

help removing screen time lock,"help removing screen time lock

I left for college recently, and despite my arguments, my parents seem unable to
believe that I need more than an hour a day on my computer for homework. I was
wondering if there was a way to simply remove the lock screen and let me
continue my work. I don't need to unblock any games or websites. I don't want to
leave the family group, as I have gigabytes of files stored through my father's
OneDrive subscription. They are genuinely nice people, just they don't know a
thing about technology and how important it is in higher education.

 > I have gigabytes of files stored through my father's OneDrive subscription
You wanna talk about Internet risks... 
 
     I use my laptop in class, and my pc while in my dorm, so it just makes sense for me



 What would happen if you called them immediately every time your homework was
interrupted by the screen lock?  It's a little petty, but worthwhile.   ""My
computer just locked right in the middle of writing my term paper, I need more
time."" - every single day   If they're really just clueless about your needs, it
might drive the point home. 
 


 This is the first ""help me circumvent parental controls"" post on this subreddit
that is actually reasonable...  What software is applying the screen time lock? 
 
     the built in Microsoft Family Safety tool with windows computers

     Exactly what I was thinking 😂  Finally, a legit “I’m too old for parental restrictions” at last.



 Buy a terabyte external hard drive transfer all your work over a few days give
them back the computer and buy one yourself. Thn they have lost that control.
You’re an adult, in college. Your parents don’t get a say in what you do at
school on your laptop. 
 
     honestly this is where I land like, I know OP claims they don't need any sites or anything unblocked but
    their parents shouldnt **have** anything blocked or the ability to randomyl stop them from using their
    computer **period.** They are an ADULT.



 Random thought. If you live with your parents, do your homework where they can
see you doing it. Make sure you have your syllabus available for the classes.
When you lose your time. Then show and explain this to your parents. If that
doesn't work. Computer labs, flash drives, and late nights at college it is. 
 
     I live in a dorm, so doing homework where they can see it wouldn't work, and I've tried showing them the
    syllabus, but I didn't have much success. Trying the computer lab isn't a bad idea. Thank you for
    suggesting that.



 Swapped or OS booting stuff 
 


 Can you factory reset your computer? Not the best option but might be the only
one if all the important stuff is in the cloud 
 


 Assuming they use the Win10/11 build-in tools:   Delete

Hirens, write to an USB stick with Rufus, boot from the stick and delete the
file on the harddrive.  hirensbootcd\*org  rufus\*ie

 As I said to a certain teenager in the house… if you don’t like my restrictions,
get your own devices and accounts and pay for them yourself.  He got a job and
his own stuff. I have no problem with this. Once he had his own stuff he
discovered that I’d had my reasons for certain restrictions, and lo! It came to
pass that he has voluntarily started behavior nearly identical to what I wanted…
except that I’m not paying for his access anymore. He can do as he likes but has
ended up doing as I wanted in the first place.

 Apple didn’t really make it strict, your parents did. They can turn it off if
they wanted. I suggest you have a polite conversation with them and explain your
point of view. 
 


 If you consider screen time limits a “hardship”, you need to spend more time
outdoors and socializing in person. 
 


 Pay for your own devices and the associated service. You’re not entitled to a

 Its because you have shitty parents who instead of communicating with you about

to a normal user and now my mum created a seperate admin account only she knows
the password to. PLEASE HELP I CAN'T TALK TO MY FRIENDS. i'm 14

 My mom never put parental controls on me, but I can understand the frustration.
The following instructions assume you have an iPhone and a windows laptop. On
your laptop (if it’s a Windows laptop) try to create a bootable drive with
Windows/Linux and use that to reinstall your os. Before doing that, consider
saving important data on an another drive to avoid losing them. To remove
Qustodio your iPhone, install iTunes on your laptop (after reinstalling the OS)
and restore the phone with it. Before doing that, also save important data (like
photos) on an another drive or iCloud) Finally, set new passwords on both
devices and never share them with your mom. 
 
     To create a bootable drive, download a new OS from the internet (either Windows from the official
    Microsoft website or a Linux distro) and use an apposite software (I suggest using BalenaEtcher) to flash
    that OS onto an USB drive. Then shut down your laptop and when you reboot it press the key to open the
    bootable drives menu (it varies depending on your laptop) and reinstall your OS from that.

     This ignores who pays the bill for the phone and home internet. 



 if you're using windows and your mom's not very good with tech i can help  if
you're using mac i can't help  if you're using linux they you should be the one
helping me 
 


 You can just reinstall a clean copy of windows on the laptop, i think. But for
the phone, i unfortunately have no idea 
 


 Tell your mom that it could be malware. That could get some parents (I am pretty
sure most parental controls apps contain malware, I could be wrong) 
 
     Idk but I just said that and she said 'oh they say it's private' no shit it's malware



 You can't talk to your friends but you can talk to random strangers on the
internet? Seems sus. 
 
     well qustodio can track imsg but not reddit comments. i use reddit as google now so my dad can't check my
    history



 Unfortunately, you're stuck in this situation until you become an adult and
start buying your own devices. 
 


 The best way to get rid of parental controls without losing data, reformation
your hard drive or phone, is actually a pretty simple idea. I mean this is the
only way that I can think of to completely rid yourself of these parental
controls...   Talk to your mum. All why?  And ask for a compromise. Make your
case, include ways that you are responsible etc.   The fact that you are able to
talk to random strangers on Reddit means that your accounts aren't that locked
down. I mean if I were her I would eliminate access the Reddit and Discord. So
consider yourself lucky. 
 


 Go talk to real friends 
 


 sticky. keys. exploit. 
 


 I mean I can't make any new friends because she has to approve every contact i
add 
 
     Yeah that's called being a good parent. You don't need to make ""friends"" with random people on the
    Internet at 14.

     So stop making fake ""friends"" on the internet and go meet people in person.

Updating Apps without screen time password,"Updating Apps without screen time password

I have a game that doesn't allow me to play unless I update the app, but I can't
update it because my phone asks for my AppleID password (which my parents keep
to themselves) and I can't change the ""Require Password"" under iTunes&App Store
purchases to ""Don't Require"" without the screen time code, which I also don't
have.  I'm going to college next year and they still aren't letting me have
freedom on my phone. I can't factory reset because my parents will get pissed at
me and probably take my phone until I'm out of the house. Is there a way to
change the password requirement for updating apps without notifying my parents
and without the screen time password?  Here's some info on the phone:  iOS
Version 18.3.2  Model Name iPhone 11  Haven't updated to iOS 26 or 18.7.1  Also,
my parents are out of the state right now so I can't have them update it. And my
mom is short-tempered so asking her to disable the password requirement is out
of the question, which she is the only one who can access my parental controls.

 if its a mainstream game you can scroll on yt or watch ads until you get an ad
for that game and then there will be a prompt in ad for you to update it.  dont
go directly to the appstore just press the udpate button and it should update 
 
     YouTube is blocked on my phone, I'm not joking when I say I have messages, my school app, basic iPhone
    apps, 2 games, and 0 access to any social media platforms   literally GOOGLE is blocked.



 iPhone 11? Sounds like it’s time for a new phone that doesn’t have screentime
crap on it. 
 
     I live in New York and labor laws for minors are weird here. Not that getting a job at 16 isn't possible,
    she just says its not worth it since a lot of paperwork is required for both parties involved (Me,
    parents, employer). So I have no way to make money! :( Even if I did make enough she would never allow me
    to buy my own device. I'm stuck with this phone until I'm out of the house and have the money to buy a new
    one.  Its kinda funny because it's visibly falling apart, battery expanding, lagging, heating up, doing
    this weird thing with the battery percentage where it goes up and down a bunch, and yet I can't get a new
    phone because ""our phone plan is too good. If we get you a new phone, then we have to switch phone plans
    because ours is old. We are not giving it up."" something like that

    emoji details, go to appstore. It isn't the full Appstore though.) which is how I usually get her to
    update my games. I just need the password or a way to bypass the password without alerting my parents :'\]
    I fear there is no way though.

 I had the same issue if you go to settings, then iPhone storage you can unload
the app and reinstall it and it might update the app?

One way to avoid you screen time limit,"One way to avoid you screen time limit

I figured out that if you have two divides like an iPad and iPhone if you turn
of your WiFi and cellular on let’s say the phone you can use up you limit on the
other device like the iPad you then turn off cellular and WiFi on the iPad then
turn on the WiFi and cellular on the iPhone you should have screen time still
you just can’t use both devices at once How Step one turn off WiFi and cellular
on device one  Step two Use up screen time on device two Step three Turn of
cellular and WiFi on device two Step four Turn on cellular and WiFi on device
one If all these steps are done in order correctly you should have twice the
screen time because it can’t send the message that you are out of time without
WiFi or cellular if you have questions please ask I will try my best to respond

 My dude.   Listen to your parents.  When I was a kid (90s) I strategized like
this against them. You’ll live to regret this as an adult. “They want what’s
best for you” isn’t just flowery words. 95% of the time their vast experience in
the world in comparison to you means that they’re right. 
 
     What if the parents are abusive or smth more

     installing malware because ""they want what's best for you""?  ***interesting***  and i don't know where you
    got the 95% from, but that's clearly not true

How do I find out my screen time passcode???,"How do I find out my screen time passcode???

I'm rlly desperate, I tried seeing the finger prints on my device but it doesn't
work and all I see is debris and scratches omg. I tried trying every combo and I
sc it from a site that shows every combinations but I gave up. I can't change my
time zone for loopholes for downtime and I have app limits. 0 minutes for each
app except for settings, App Store and some stupid ones. I need to ask for time
for more. Can someone help? How can i use the calling, and screen sharing
method? I tried but my other device doesn't have the button to control my
screen.

 Someone online smeared butter on their screen (if this is touchscreen) and then
asked their parent to fill it in for them, then they looked at the butter
patterns and which spots were clicked on in order to massively reduce the number
of possibilities. It's kinda gross and I'm not sure why the parent didn't wipe
it off for them but it worked for them somehow. 
 


 Look at the repo thehappydinoa/iOSRestrictionBruteForce on github.  Not sure if
it'll work on recent versions but I'd say its worth a shot 
 


 Ok so clean your phone all the way off and click into the “enter screen time
passcode” so that they hopefully only touch the screen to put in the password
and the amount of time they’re giveing and have them do this a couple times and
compile where the 5 finger prints are and which one you assume is the click they
put the amount of time given in and then figer out what numbers they clicked
based on the finger prints ask Google to show you every possible 4 digit code
made by those numbers and look at the ridges of the finger prints to assume what
order they put in the numbers. I sound like such a nerd but I got it in 4 days
with this method remember when they put in the code on your phone it resets the
amount of attempts and obviously try to peek when they do it good luck 🍀 also
keep in mind the same number might be used more than once in the code (that what
happened in my case) 
 


 Not sure if this will help but when you try to brute force the code on iPhone it
remembers every try but if you have an Apple Watch and you go to the privacy
settings on that, it asks for the screen time password but doesn’t record failed
attempts. I figured this out and was able to brute force my password after a few
days but I did end up being lucky 
 
     when was the last time you tried this?? recently? i’m thinking about trying it out. i figured out that
    now, even if your parent puts the password in on your phone, it sends a notification to the
    parent/guardians phone that the password has been entered and for which app. does it do that with the
    apple watch?



 At least you have the App Store. My dad disabled that too 
 
     I haven’t even got many apps so I don’t know why he did it

     oh no. that’s messed up 



 I feel you my parents are super strict and I ive figord out my password 3 times
but they got smart and installed this thing to tell them whenever the password
is put in so it only lasts a day i once tryd using my mom old phone but now the
wifi shows wich devices are on the conection so i dont just need to figur out
the password i need to reset it all together any idias 
 
     How did you figure it out?



 secrently come and see   thats what l did 
 


 nice hun 
 


 If you have a burner phone with no sim can it still connect to internet 
 


 Did you set the passcode for yourself and then forgot it?

Help With Windows 11 Screen Time Bypass,"Help With Windows 11 Screen Time Bypass

Hi! I am 15 and am sick of parental controls. During the school year, I
maintaned all A's, had a healthy social life (went out with friends 4-5 times a
week), do extracurriculars and have plenty of free time. My issue is the fact
that I am given 1 hour a day to play games or watch youtube, which for me
especially during the summer is basically nothing. I didn't really mind this
before due to how I had more stuff to keep me busy during the school year, but
now all my friends are on vacation, it's too hot to go outside (I live in Vegas)
and I have nothing to do. I tried Utilman, but my laptop has bitlocker. I have
access to a usb thumb drive if that can help, and any and all advice is greatly
appreciated. Have a lovely day!

 I'm not sure how to bypass that in win11, but I'd be tempted to just nuke it and
install a simple Linux distro like Linux Mint to get around this entirely.   If
you're ok getting rid of W11 after backing up all your data. It's a very easy
process. 1. Download ISO 2. Download Rufus 3. Open Rufus and flash ISO to USB 4.
Open BIOS to disable secure boot and change boot order (USB first) 5. Then just
follow the steps on the installer.  It's also nice because nowadays you can use
chatgpt to get help with installing Linux without getting yelled at haha, used
to be way harder. 
 
     Is it possible to still access the other account with screen time if I do this? My mom will surely notice
    because she checks at least once every 2 weeks.



 Wipe drive, start over without the extra junk? 
 


 Dumb question here, have you tried talking to them about increasing it for just
the summer? I know my parents just didn’t want it to get in the way of school so
once I talked to them they increased it for the summer 
 
     I have, but they tell me that it's summer and that I should do something more productive. I already read
    and exercise, (currently reading crime and punishment which is a great book) and they still have the
    mentality that screens melt your brain.



 I'm so sorry. 
 


 Did you try asking your parents to adjust the settings or turn them off? 
 


 I've heard something about a sticky keys bypass but I really don't know much
about it.  If you're willing to learn and make some risks, you COULD partition
your drive and install Linux. But that is very risky since Windows and Linux
don't play nice on the same drive. What i recommend you do if you want to go the
Linux route, get a 500gb external USB and install Linux onto there. 
 
     They play perfectly fine on the same drive so long as Linux is installed second; installing Windows second
    fucks up the bootloader, since Windows likes to install its own.   The more salient issue for OP would be
    the bootloader menu on boot giving them away. Easier to install on an external drive. If OP is concerned
    about gaming, Bazzite might be a fuck-up-proof solution (but I'd also argue that for a kid, learning about
    Linux and fucking it up a bit is valuable in its own right).

     fuckkk Google reloaded & deleted my comment  It's literally the same thing, likely sprang up due to the 2
    most common apps swapped with Command. I say we get rid of this 2 name bullshit & call it Swapped.  I
    didn't know until now that Windows updates like to mess with the boot partition, & of course you can use a
    USB stick as well or even another internal drive if your motherboard allows it. It'll also be faster due
    to the type of connection.  Windows 10 currently works just fine, it's a great OS that rivals Linux &
    despite being EoL that doesn't actually mean anything yet, just get a good antivirus like Malwarebytes.

     do you have a good guide I could use for the flash drive method with linux?



 Install puppy Linux iso to thumb drive, make thumb drive bootable and just side
boot your OS that way its parent safe so long as you remember to pull the thumb
drive. 
 


 I’m not gonna tell you not to bypass them.  (i had friends growing up with
psycho strict parents)  However, i also had friends who *really* needed to dial
it back for their own good.  So, ima give you this advice.  Take a minute, sit
with yourself and really think “Is this actually unfair, or is it good for me”
then more importantly if/when you decide to bypass it.  YOU ARE NOT AS SNEAKY AS
YOU THINK YOU ARE.  whatever you think the odds are that you’re gonna be caught.
multiply that by at-least 10x.   What is your plan for how to handle it when
you’re caught.  Again i ain’t saying not to do it. (personally i think the
restrictions are way too much).  but take the time to think through the
consequences of getting caught and if it’s worth it to you.   People love to
talk about “kids being dumb” which is rude and wrong.  However a lot of it stems
from us seeing kids who take actions without considering the consequences.
consider them and make your decision.  or as the quote goes “Do what you want,
then pay for it.”  (note. consequences in this context is not a synonym for
punishment, punishment may be part of the consequences, but so is something as
simple as losing trust.)   If you go for it, others have great tips for how and
i wish you the best of luck!  but be sure this is a choice you want to make and
have thought through, and are ready to face the fallout from if/when caught. 
 
     They will be caught. It's not a question about if, but when. What's the point of playing games if you
    can't immerse yourself into them? And then when you do... game over.



 What happens after the hour? Do all apps lock down? If some remain usable,
download vmware and make a virtual machine. That vm will have no restrictions. 
 


 login, and hold shift with re start.  and then after go to winRE, go to command
prompt in the advance setting.  run these commands:  C:  cd C:
//Windows/System32 (sorry if it wrong cause I'm on mobile typing)  ren
utilman.exe utilman.old  copy cmd.exe utilman.exe  and type exit and continue...
After all go to home screen and type Ctrl+U (hold ctrl and u together)  and you
will see the cmd prompt.  and then type this command in:  taskmgr     then go

 dont know of one, sadly. i made an application a few years ago on for windows
machines. it wont work on mac. but idk if it still works as its literally a
thing that downloads all the info via iTunes, iCloud, etc onto your computer and
decrypts it through brute force. prolly patched by now....but the basic idea is
still pretty much the same. get the system files then decrypt and locate the
screen time passcode. all the software out there requires payment for some
reason, sadly. could try making your own though it does require quite a bit of
computer science knowledge. thats all i have, sorry if i couldnt help you. hope
ya find a way. 
 


 I’m confused. Does screen time also include texting? Netflix I could see as
screen time. 
 
     It's device wide screen time



 20min is insanely short for Netflix. If you invest this for like 2-3months to
learn some hacks mb u can do it yourself (not saying it’s ez, this only for the
hyper talented)  Now if you r not the best at coding, your luck is in GitHub or
google search, look for forums  For as much as I know, such a magical thing has
not appeared yet( else ppl can just get your phone password hm?)   Other options
involve changing your phone to android(with or without parental consent, that
is, buying one yourself) or explain what Netflix is to your dad 
 


 No and u will get yo shit hacked  I got a method for macOS to completely get rid
of screen time tho so hit dm If u want ts 
 


 Unfortunately the fix for that was patched in IOS13. However, if you can scrape
together 20/30 dollars, burners/prepaid phones run on Wi-Fi and are relatively
cheap. Also, I’m sorry people are being so pathetic to you in this comment
section. 
 


 Sorry kiddo, no way to do it. You’ll either have to prove that you are mature
enough or wait until you turn 18 to get a phone. 
 
     how about don't say anything if you're not going to be helpful?  also, did you even read the post? 20
    minutes is a very small amount of screen time

Local law requires screen time lock?,"Local law requires screen time lock?

16, Victoria AU. Recently my PC required a parent sign in saying it was part of
""local law"" and my parent signed in with absolutely no issue. But then it
implemented a timed lock without consulting any of us, and we can't figure out
how to remove it. Anyone have similar experience/advice? This is especially
important as I start VCE in a few days and have been informed that a good
majority of revision material is online.

 ""Parent sign in"" to *what*, exactly, with what kind of account? *Where* did this
appear? Directly in the OS or in a browser? Who did it say was providing the
""message""? How did it know who was or was not a kid or a parent?   Australia
does have some moronic law meant to keep kids off of social media, but what
you're describing sounds more like malware taking advantage of that fact to
harvest passwords, and then mess with the computer for who-knows-what, possibly
extortion.  Start by making a backup of everything on that machine, because
there is a good chance you'll have to wipe it. Then *please* try to provide some
real information.

 Looks like a malware. 
 


 Obviously malware, Parental Controls have a critical con: Since parents trust
them(authoritarian ones also on siege), scammers take advantage of it, either it
would be useful to bypass it, or in this case, it wrecks both you and your
parent, just reinstall windows or whatever OS you have, BACKUP YOUR FILES 
 


 Do you need windows for anything? 
 


 This is a malware. Phishing scam. Takes advantage of parental trust in parental
control software.   This right here is one of the big reasons I don’t recommend
them to anyone.  
 


 probably automatically adding shit because some dumbass set the account age
under 18  I really couldn't tell you based off this information, you could
always reinstall an OS & use a local account or something 
 
     this

     Good luck getting windows to let you have a local account these days! They're patching every fix for it. I
    found my solution in NotWindows(tm)

can't enter it because my parents will get a notification every time i do it) I

16 on ios 18.5 I can't factory reset my phone or change the time/language/region
I can't talk it out with my parents because they won't want to listen  This is
really urgent because I'm talking to a girl i really Like on instagram and I
can't continue because of this screen time  Does the assistive touch function
still work?  Or should I just wait till i turn 18 next year and get my own
phone?   Thanks!  [Edit]: Is there also any way if the screen time doesn't show
up on my parents phone when I use the restricted apps? For example the game
screen time doesnt appear on my parents phone after i disable the restriction.
Thanks!

 As a parent... what in the world did you do or not do?  1 minute of games?  At
17?  I'm not trying to take the piss here, but why even have a phone? 
 
     I think his screen time limits are far too low

     My parents have been strict on me since day 1 and they believe phones aren't meant for games and strictly
    for communication purposes. Ive tried to tell them about this and it's not even like i have bad grades or
    anything. They wont budge



 turn off cellular & wifi, enter the password, then turn cellular and wifi back
on  i tested it, and it worked for me  i was on 18.5 too and it worked  lmk if
it works for u too  \-----------------------     for the factory reset thing,
another guy posted how to reset ur phone about a day ago. user name is
[Bubbynolastname13](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bubbynolastname13/)     ""when
you try to erase your iPhone normally it will ask for a screen time passcode.
But if you do this, you won't have to put it in. All you need is the apple id
password. First, log on to icloud on the website, then go to find my, select
your device, then tap on erase. Go through all the steps. Then, after that, your
device will erase. Then, start setting it up. You will need to do activation
lock, and this is the key reason why I said you need to apple id password. Then,
continue setting it up, and make sure that you sign in with a different apple
id, not the one that has the parental controls. Then, boom! You have
successfully taken the parental controls off of your phone. Enjoy!"" 
 
     An actual helpful answer. I'm not part of this sub but for some reason reddit recommended it to me. It's
    almost always full of jaded adults in the comments asking why someone would want to go around parental
    controls. At 17 years old, I don't see why an *almost legal adult* needs their screen time limited like a
    10 year old with an iPad on Minecraft.   ""What did you do to get punished with 10 minutes of screen time?""
    is ridiculous. If you haven't prepared your almost adult-teen with access to the internet, you have failed
    as a parent. Strict parents create sneaky kids. Don't be this kind of asshole parent.

     Alright, will try it  Thanks a lot!

you can download apps from the galaxy store without permission so that's were u

Bypass screen time,"Bypass screen time

Hello. for some context, my parents prohibit social media in my house.
Previously i had this phone monitoring app called bark. Eventually we moved onto
apple family screen time. I knew the passcode, so i got these apps and turned it
all off. Cut forward to saturday, my parents found out. They deleted all the
apps and put a 0 hour 0 minute limit on them, and then changed the password. I
really want to use the discord app, to talk to my friends, but its under the
time limit. I dont know the code, and i am on ios 18.4. Is there anyway i can
bypass this limit. Thank you

 you should just get your friends’ phone numbers 
 
     online friends



 You can use discord as a website, not just an app. 
 


 Gonna have to find out that password :/  Apple doesn’t really play with allowing
bypasses like that 
 


 You could try using the browser version on a computer (library computer?) 
 


 If you need only web, settings is unlocked (it probably is because u cant block
it i believe), go to settings, apps, mail click on mail accounts then add
account, click google, then click help, and type or find in the results 'search
on google', find and click the redirect to google, then if u want to go to dc
search for discord.com/app and log in (the ui looks a little weird and you have
to log in every time but its worth it) 
 


 Consider changing your time in General>Date and time in settings, or looking at
other posts. I’ll link you one if I can when I find it 
 
     yeah i mean the changing the time is blocked and even if it wasnt i dont think it could help if its under
    a 0 hour time limit



 Yes their is I’m 16 with a screen time as well all you need to to is go to

prompt you to enter the screen time password but if you notice on the bottom of
the screen it will say something along the lines of “ Use a new passcode” or
something like that so what you do is click on enter screen time passcode and
then when on the number keyboard screen you click above it on that white bar and
it will change the screen allowing you to assess a new code for assisitive
acess. Then just add the apps you want. Sorry for my ability to spell lol. 
 
     wait what i domt really understand 



 Js a question do u have access to a laptop 
 
     Uhmm yes



 weblocs if youre desperate 
 


 Try to screen record them typing the password Just use a 3rd party one, or just
sneak onto their computer and unlock it from there. 
 
     Which screen recorders screen record the password?

iOS 26 - Huge changes coming to Screen Time,"iOS 26 - Huge changes coming to Screen Time

Hello everyone! I'm that one beta tester who's made a few posts about upcoming
changes to Screen Time. The iOS 26 Developer Beta came out a little over two
weeks ago, and I've been testing it since day one.  I've found a couple of big
changes related to Screen Time, and I thought I'd share them here to warn anyone
who uses these.  First, One More Minute usage has completely changed, and I'm
not sure exactly how it works yet. Using One More Minute on an app allows all
apps for one minute, and every Downtime session only some apps have One More
Minute available. For example, one night Apple TV might have One More Minute
available, but the next time it doesn't. I thought this was a bug, so I reported
it to Apple but they marked my report as ""Investigation complete - Works as
currently designed"" This means this weird setup will most likely make it to the
official release in September.  Second, custom in-app browsers are not included
in Screen Time, meaning Downtime shuts them off, and app limits apply. I
previously used the Bible app's built-in browser, but Downtime shuts it off now.
Surprisingly, the web browser in Settings > Mail > Accounts > Add Account >
Google > Privacy > Nine dots still works!  I know this is long, but hopefully
someone finds these useful! Let me know if you want me to test anything in iOS
26 related or unrelated to Screen Time. Also feel free to ask any questions!

 Do you know how to Bypass some of These 
 
     I haven’t found any bypasses yet, but I’ll let you know if I do! The one I mentioned in the post is the
    web browser in Settings, which is technically a bypass.



 Can you please confirm that in app browsers now show up as “chrome” “google” or
“safari” on 26? I’ve heard some rumors that all the browser exploits will show
up as the browser and not the app it’s in 
 
     I just ran the in-app browser in the Bible app, and it showed up as Bible in Screen Time. Is this what
    you’re asking for?

     i have seen differently, i have it and it shows time on every website you use even in the in app browser..
    i’ve found a way in pinterest, and in my screen time it shows pinterest time AND the time i spent on the
    website 

     I used the Pinterest browser to bypass, but this no longer works in ios 26, if anyone has any advice
    please let me know.



 i agree! i have been testing since day one too, and i found out the answer to a
few of these   For the “One more minute” it is not per app any more, when you
use one more minute, in unlocks all apps for one minute and then your one more
minute will not come back, so use your one more minute wisely   the in app
browsers, yes are also shut down… but… another warning… any website you go to is
logged in screen time.. so if you were on reddit, it would show time that you
spent on reddit in your screen time, even if you were using an in app browser
hope this helps! 
 
     I wonder if One More Minute is still broken then? For me, after using it it’ll use it on all of my apps
    but like last night eBay had an extra One More Minute while all the others didn’t.



 If you use the settings method, does it show in screentime as settings still or
does it show the individual websites. 
 
     Thankfully only shows as Settings!



 I had screetime on for some settings and now 16 of my apps are missing. Only way
to get them back is turnoff screentime. Utter mess 
 
     It’s an age restriction issue! If you go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > App
    Store, Media, Web, & Games and change Apps to something higher (like 18+) it should fix your issue!



 Hi! I have the problem now where I want to be able to access those browsers if I
have downtime. This was my problem: Before downloading iOS 26 public beta, I
could use the Chrome App and Browser normally, also if I had downtime (because
Chrome was (and still is) in my ""Always Allowed"" Apps). Now, I have limit for
all websites. Is there any way to turn this off (so that it works like before)? 
 
     You’d have to allow all websites in Downtime settings now

     If you use the Chrome app and search using Incognito, you can bypass the screen time restrictions. The
    thing is you can only type in links, and if your parents have limit adult websites on, searching those
    links won't work. If it says that it's still restricted or restricts when you switch to a different link
    close the app then reopen it.



 Can you please explain to me how to get to the nine dots part? I press the
privacy and it takes me to apple website i dont know what to do from there 
 
     Ah, ok so you actually went to the wrong website. When you’re on the list of email services, select
    Google. Then, privacy. There should be nine dots in the top right of your screen!



 In Screen Time, the toggle to allow apps with Screen Time access is still only
protected by Face ID in iOS 18, rendering all third-party screen time apps
useless. Has Apple changed this?   Also, does Downtime still completely block
all websites in Safari? 
 
     These are my two biggest gripes with Screen Time



 what do you mean by 9 dots in the bypass?? 
 
     Settings > Apps > Mail > Mail Accounts > Add Account > click “choose from a list.” > Google > Open Browser
    > click “Privacy” at the bottom > click the nine dots at the top right (3x3 square of dots, next to the
    Sign in button) > Search



 How do I set app limits?

Method to disguise apps in MacOS and hide them from Screen Time,"Method to disguise apps in MacOS and hide them from Screen Time

Just discovered a new way to bypass screen time reporting in MacOS and cloak
apps in a different name and icon in Mac (spoiler, ITS SO STUPIDLY SIMPLE!!!).
Anyone who requires this stuff, please suggest a means of communication, because
I am worried that if it goes public, it will be patched.  This setup works even
with third party parental control apps that block websites. My config allows me
to use only Safari, and Kaspersky Safe Kids blocks certain websites. I found a
way to visit the sites using a dev tool, but since it was still safari, it
reported my activity to screen time. This does not happen for other browsers,
but using them will make them show up on screen time. This technique bypasses
that and hides app usage. It disguises the app and fools the OS into thinking it
is Safari (or whatever app u want it to be!). Chances are that this wont get
patched, and will have workarounds even if it is. Still wanna be careful tho, so
not posting out in the open.  Edit: Have decided to just show it  Here's how to
do this.  First, get your app as a DMG or as an installer. Extract the app from
there(This is basic in DMGs, just drag and drop the app into downloads or
something, your choice). If you have a PKG installer, look it up on the
internet. It's a bit of a pain.  Next, open the contents of the app(right click
and show contents) and navigate to info.plist. This is the file that needs to be
edited. Open it in TextEdit or in Nano(terminal). From there, search for the
CFBundleIndentifier and CFBundleName. Change these to com.apple.Safari(or any
other app's identifier that you want) and Safari(or other app name)
respectively. Save and exit.  Open terminal and remove your app from quarantine
with  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/program.app  And then codesign in
with the following  codesign --remove-signature /path/to/program.app  codesign
-s - --deep --force /path/to/program.app  And now to prevent anyone from seeing
it,  chflags hidden /path/to/program.app  Use Shift+Cmd+Period to see these
hidden apps.  Thats it, youre done!  Edit 2 -   Sometimes you need to add
<key>CFBundleSupportedPlatforms</key>    <array>  <string>MacOSX</string>
</array>  to info.plist to troubleshoot ""You cannot use this version of this app
with this version of MacOS""  Edit 3- Sometimes you have to change the
CFBundleSignature tag from whatever has been written there to this thing - ???
Only then will the codesign work. This is rare, but you know what to try if
things go wrong.

 so do people have to dm you or smth? 
 
     probably

     Ya know what? Forget it imma post out in the open



 watch it be a basic feature of Mac OS, after all this exists in Windows   matter
of fact just change some code & you're golden (gl decompiling things that aren't
open source though lol)  wth is ""a dev tool"", do you mean iframes? 
 
     Thats right! I never got this info online, so I decided to put it up. But what decompiling r u talking
    about? If thats another workaround, please share it here! My ""dev tool"" wasnt really a dev tool, it was
    Safari Technology Preview.



 have you tried using windows like a normal person? 
 
     My parents make me use mac due to the security controls on MacOS



 OP, this is a neat trick.   If you think it might be an actual bug or security
vulnerability, you should review some of the apple docs, make sure you don't see
what you're doing in there listed as a feature.
[httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/screentimeapidocumentation
[Httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/ManagedSettings
[Httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/familycontrols/
[Httpswww]developer.apple.com/documentation/deviceactivity/
[Httpswww]support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-is-screen-time-mchlfb0b5864/mac
If a skim through their docs doesn't appear to show what you're doing as an
available feature then consider whether you might like to submit it as a bug
bounty. Bug bounties are programs where a tech vendor will pay out for finding
vulnerabilities in their products. security.apple.com/bounty/  Also you might
have a mind for hacking or penetration testing. You should consider that as you
grow. 
 
     Thats really nice of you! Thanks! I'll mull over it for a while before I decide whether to submit or not.
    But man, its heartening that there are good people on the internet who will not steal ideas! Hats off to
    you!



 is this still working? i tried to do this but only got that I can't use the app
with my version of macOS 
 
     thats a codesignature thing

     fix it by editing the signature id in the app to ??? and then resign in yourself



 will this affect the app that you’re disguising it as? for example you are
changing the app identifier to safari, so will the actual safari app be affected
in any way? 
 
     The functioning won’t be, but whatever screen time you spend on that app may or may not be redirected to
    safari in screen time. I’m not sure about this, because most of the time whatever time I spend on that app
    just goes into a grey bar and doesn’t identify as any app’s screen time. Worst case scenario, screen time
    is redirected that’s it



 does this still work?  when i do codesign -s --deep --force /path/to/program.app
it says "" --deep no identity found"" 
 
     which version of MacOS r u on? cuz the command still works on mine. try something like replacing the order
    of --deep --force to --force --deep. I just looked it up, and --deep is apparently deprecated, has been
    since macOS 13. It is still in macOS, but run the command    man codesign   and see if a --deep entry
    shows up



 When I try to input the xattr command it says no such file 
 
     Specifically there’s so such file for path/to/program



 help i didd this for turning roblox into arc(my browser) and now arc is showing
up as roblox instead of the other way?? pls help. 
 
     What did you do? Did you edit the info.plist file of Arc or Roblox?

iOS screen time frustration,"iOS screen time frustration

We have screen time limits set for my kid but somehow this kid is on Snapchat
for 5 hours a day and I don’t understand how it’s happening. Is there any point
to apple screen time? It is a joke.

 You probably missed the block at end of time toggle. There's one at downtime and
another for app limits. Bring the query to r/Parenting 
 


 Make sure iOS is updated. Find the setting that disables installation of apps.
Change the Screen Time pin code and never type in the pin code on your kids
device. 
 


 Tell your kid that if he/she continues to not respect screen time rules, you’ll
change it so the kid only gets x amount of data on the cell plan. 
 


 Just as a head up, this sub is mainly kids looking to subvert parental controls
and they will likely just jump on you for asking.   To answer, there are a
couple of ways for your kids to get around it, but we would really need to know
the entire set up to be able to answer you completely. The apple screen time
function has some good uses, but no app is going to be foolproof.   Try the
search function on this sub instead of a post, it might help and you can get a
better understanding of what the kids are doing to breakthrough. Also understand
that being able to truly monitor and lockdown use is basically a part to full
time job in and of itself. You will not be able to simply set one app and have
it do most of the work. You’ll need to be actively monitoring your end *and* the
device being restricted. 
 
     Thanks for your response and suggestions. And lol yes I saw the ratio of parent/ kid posts. If kids I
    don’t know jump on me for asking I will shake my fist at the sky and rail against the young people these
    days.



 ""this kidd"" 
 


 Wrong sub but what kid is spending 5 hours a day on Snapchat 😭 Snapchat is NOT
that exiting 
 


 iPhone has a glitch where even after the screentime runs out and u can’t use
apps anymore, it continues to run in the background for some reason. For example
I have a one hour YouTube limit and I’ve never tried to circumvent it but I’d be
getting like more than two hours on it 
 


 Update his phone to 26 
 


 they likley know your screen time password 
 


 I've just found a third party screen time app and it's waaaay better than Apples
joke... I think it's unique as it gets a reward system if you want to... the kid
needs to complete some learning apps in order to unlock their reward apps... I
find it a creative idea though and incentivize the kids to do smthg useful with
their devices

why the hell did apple have to make screen time stricter on ios 26?,"why the hell did apple have to make screen time stricter on ios 26?

why did apple have to make screen time stricter on ios 26? its already was
annoying before now its like they're trying to control everything we do on our
phone, especially since im off downtime for 1 hour out of the entire day. its
like apple just decided to make every teenagers life harder for fun. like wtf is
the point of having a phone if you cant use it how you want to?

 To better support parents?  Not a good era to have kids online in. 
 
     Happy cake day!

     And screen time limits aren’t a good way to ensure your child’s safety online past like 10 years old



 As I said to a certain teenager in the house… if you don’t like my restrictions,
get your own devices and accounts and pay for them yourself.  He got a job and
his own stuff. I have no problem with this. Once he had his own stuff he
discovered that I’d had my reasons for certain restrictions, and lo! It came to
pass that he has voluntarily started behavior nearly identical to what I wanted…
except that I’m not paying for his access anymore. He can do as he likes but has
ended up doing as I wanted in the first place. 
 
     Upvoted!!!



 Apple didn’t really make it strict, your parents did. They can turn it off if
they wanted. I suggest you have a polite conversation with them and explain your
point of view. 
 


 If you consider screen time limits a “hardship”, you need to spend more time
outdoors and socializing in person. 
 


 Pay for your own devices and the associated service. You’re not entitled to a
phone. 
 


 im sorry but **WHAT**- your parents got stricter. Apple improved some features,
for example, you can download apps above your age rating with permission from
your parents. 
 


 Yeah… this post is the reason you *need* screen time limits. 
 


 So sad  Ill start looking for bypassed 
 


 Its because you have shitty parents who instead of communicating with you about
internet stuff and what they are worried about. They just restrict, restrict,
restrict.  Hate parents like that. 
 
     This is the very reason why they restrict it. Simple buy your own device pay for your own service then you
    won’t need to worry about it.

Updating Apps without screen time password,"Updating Apps without screen time password

I have a game that doesn't allow me to play unless I update the app, but I can't
update it because my phone asks for my AppleID password (which my parents keep
to themselves) and I can't change the ""Require Password"" under iTunes&App Store
purchases to ""Don't Require"" without the screen time code, which I also don't
have.  I'm going to college next year and they still aren't letting me have
freedom on my phone. I can't factory reset because my parents will get pissed at
me and probably take my phone until I'm out of the house. Is there a way to
change the password requirement for updating apps without notifying my parents
and without the screen time password?  Here's some info on the phone:  iOS
Version 18.3.2  Model Name iPhone 11  Haven't updated to iOS 26 or 18.7.1  Also,
my parents are out of the state right now so I can't have them update it. And my
mom is short-tempered so asking her to disable the password requirement is out
of the question, which she is the only one who can access my parental controls.

 if its a mainstream game you can scroll on yt or watch ads until you get an ad
for that game and then there will be a prompt in ad for you to update it.  dont
go directly to the appstore just press the udpate button and it should update 
 
     YouTube is blocked on my phone, I'm not joking when I say I have messages, my school app, basic iPhone
    apps, 2 games, and 0 access to any social media platforms   literally GOOGLE is blocked.



 iPhone 11? Sounds like it’s time for a new phone that doesn’t have screentime
crap on it. 
 
     I live in New York and labor laws for minors are weird here. Not that getting a job at 16 isn't possible,
    she just says its not worth it since a lot of paperwork is required for both parties involved (Me,
    parents, employer). So I have no way to make money! :( Even if I did make enough she would never allow me
    to buy my own device. I'm stuck with this phone until I'm out of the house and have the money to buy a new
    one.  Its kinda funny because it's visibly falling apart, battery expanding, lagging, heating up, doing
    this weird thing with the battery percentage where it goes up and down a bunch, and yet I can't get a new
    phone because ""our phone plan is too good. If we get you a new phone, then we have to switch phone plans
    because ours is old. We are not giving it up."" something like that



 Is the game from Supercell? Also, you should be allowed to update apps without
the passcode, so that’s strange. 
 
     Nope, its from a company called KuroGames. It's called Wuthering Waves. My mom has the Appstore hidden for
    me, but I found a loophole using iPhone stickers (Hold tap on a sticker you send to someone, click on
    emoji details, go to appstore. It isn't the full Appstore though.) which is how I usually get her to
    update my games. I just need the password or a way to bypass the password without alerting my parents :'\]
    I fear there is no way though.



 DM me, I’ve got a Screen Time disabler 
 


 I had the same issue if you go to settings, then iPhone storage you can unload
the app and reinstall it and it might update the app? 
 
     I actually tried that and it didn't update it :(

Way to remove Screen Time restrictions on iPad/iPhone,"Way to remove Screen Time restrictions on iPad/iPhone

This may be risky, but I figured it out. You will need a **Mac laptop** and **a
cord that connects the Mac and the iPhone/iPad**. If you don't have those
things, leave this post.  First, create an entirely new Apple account by going
to icloud . com. That is the one you will use to log into the resetted mobile
device with.  **BEFORE YOU DO THIS, BACKUP YOUR ORIGINAL APPLE ID IF YOU REGRET
IT AND WANT TO GO BACK TO GET ALL YOUR OLD DATA.**   Put your mobile device on
**restore mode**. Rapidly press the volume up button, then the volume down
button, then hold down the power button until you see the 'Restore mode' screen.
If this doesn't make sense, look up a video.  Connect your device to a Mac with
the cord. Open ""Finder"", and you'll see the device on the side if it's
connected. From there, restore the connected mobile device.  Once it's done
restarting, it will be completely reset, like brand new. Restore mode is the
only way to factory a device without a screen time passcode required. Now, from
here, sign into the Apple ID you just created.  This may be risky for multiple
reasons, however:  1. If and when your parents go onto your device, they will
probably find it's completely erased and be upset.   2. Your data (like contacts
and photos) will be all gone unless you log back into your old Apple ID.   3. If
you had a lot of necessary data on your old Apple ID, then it will be a bit of a
hassle to go back and get it all from scratch if you're really that desperate.
From here, if you had a subscription to Apple Music, then you can just log into
Apple Music and restore your library with your old Apple ID and it won't affect
the rest of your phone. Also, if you downloaded any apps from the resetted mode
and then logged back into your old Apple ID, those apps you downloaded without
requesting a parent will be on your phone even when logging back into the
original Apple ID.  Enjoy, my strict-parented, controlled children.

NOTHING....yes you can try to wipe your phone but thats probably disabled.
Instead of being sneaky and deceitful what about asking your parents if there
was something you could do to get those apps/times unlocked. Chores without
asking, pet care, sports, working out etc.

iOS screen time keeps disabling itself …again.,"iOS screen time keeps disabling itself …again.

Had this before. Eventually it went away for no discernible reason.   Just
noticed the kids seemed a little too preoccupied and quiet to discover for the
3rd time this month all screen time settings had disabled themselves.   She’s 10
now so I really gave her the gears on self-controlling when the restrictions
don’t kick in. (She was tripling our targets)  But this, frankly, is complete
fucking bullshit. Apple is no help. Everyone else seems to be just fine. Has
anyone else experienced anything at all like this and has advice? I’m in tears
with frustration.

 Are your Screen Time settings shared between devices / on the same Apple ID, or
managed separately / per device / per Apple ID?  Do you manage the settings from
one central device (i.e. the parent phone / tablet)?  I've found that there were
times when I'd make some minor change from my phone, and it wouldn't then push
down to the kids' devices.  It took me grabbing their devices while they were at
school one day, fully disabling Screen Time on all devices, restarting the
devices, re-enabling Screen Time everywhere, and then things seemed to sync up
again successfully.   We also have a multi-device-per-kid household though, so
it could have been the case for us that one tablet was holding on to settings /
prohibiting settings changes in the ""share settings with all devices"" setup.  No
idea.  But the prevailing messaging on Apple's help forums seemed to also be to
disable and then re-enable everything. 
 
     Using the Family concept, their have their own accounts managed by my parent account.   The rest of your
    story feels kind of exactly like what is going on. But its going on a LOT. I will try to ""clean slate""
    approach you just described.



 I have the opposite problem. Sometimes, my Screen Time will shut off 5 hours
earlier than scheduled. Also an Apple device.

I recently have been having arguments and started getting controlled. They
installed two parental control managers which is screen time family sharing (not
safe because it disallowed social media) and Qustodio (useless because it
destroys internet connection) and made my phone so hot and slow. I need more
privacy and independence from family members. What to do?

 Generally you don’t use 2 at once. One is tired into the os and the other has
low level control. This sub has lots of threads 
 


 Qustodio is literally trash and a spyware, you can delete it any time without
any problems, on the other hand apple screen time is more complex. You can reset

getting another phone but incase that doesn't work is there anyway to bypass the
built in apple screen time?

     my mom paid for it

     thank you

 3 hours daily is more than enough. No one should use their phone more than that.

Screen time app review,"Screen time app review

I could have used this, hopes it helps others. My review of OurPact which also
speaks to Qustudio. I did both software installs over the past two weekends.
TL;DR: Installation of OurPact on a MacBook is very flawed. Two big pitfalls:
(1) if you forget to turn off Find My iPhone before supervising, you can “half-
install” and brick the device until you wipe and restore it; and (2) the Mac
installer (DMG) doesn’t behave the way you’d expect — you try to drag it into
Applications but it just opens in a loop. Both issues wasted hours. That said,
once it’s installed, the app itself works fairly well: it’s simple, flexible,
allows you to add more time when needed, and importantly doesn’t completely lock
kids out of communication. Honestly, I wouldn’t have made it through setup
without outside help, but the product is better than the alternatives.  The
Details (for other parents)  I started with OurPact, hit its limitations, then
tried a competitor (Qustodio/QStudio), and came back to OurPact. This review is
written by someone who actually used both.  Installation Experience (the bad):
•       It took me five hours the first weekend to install across my kids’
devices. Even once I understood the quirks, it still took two hours on the redo.
•       On a MacBook, the installer is confusing. The DMG doesn’t drag into
Applications like most apps; instead it just opens repeatedly. I eventually got
it working, but it’s not intuitive and wastes tons of time.         •       The
worst pitfall: if you plug a child’s device in before turning off Find My, you
can “half-install” the supervision profile. That leaves the phone stuck in limbo
— saying it’s managed, but not actually working. The only way out is to back up
the phone, wipe it completely, and restore from backup. This is not explained
clearly by the app. Parents deserve a big red warning here.  Functionality (the
good):         •       Once it’s running, OurPact is much more balanced than the
competition.         •       Apple’s built-in Screen Time doesn’t do the job.
OurPact is simple: you set an allowance (say, 2 hours per day), then you decide
what’s always allowed (Messages, Calls, FaceTime, school apps), and the rest
counts against the daily time.         •       If your child uses up their time,
you can easily grant more (extra 15–30 minutes, etc.) through the parent app.
•       Compared to QStudio: OurPact doesn’t totally lock the phone after
allowance is up. With QStudio, my kids couldn’t even send a text once time
expired, which just creates frustration. QStudio also tries to block 16
categories of web content by default, which is overkill — we found even Young
Sheldon blocked because a character drinks beer. That level of filtering just
makes kids hate the app.         •       OurPact instead focuses on time, not
content policing. If my child burns 5 hours on Snapchat, I can move Snapchat
into the allowance pool. They can still text or call us, but the endless
scrolling is capped. That’s the right balance.  Overall:         •
Installation is awful. Expect frustration, especially on Mac. You must turn off
Find My before plugging in or you will pay for it with hours of recovery.
•       The app itself is solid. It works, it’s simple, and it strikes the
balance of giving parents control without cutting kids off from communication.
•       My kids actually preferred going back to OurPact after trying the
competitor. That says something.  Generous 3 stars — it deserves a ding for
setup being so painful, but once running, it’s the best option out there.

 Thanks for sharing your experience! I have a quick clarifying question. Is the
main thing you were looking for to limit the overall time spent on some set of
apps? The built-in Apple Screen Time can limit per-app but I don't think it has
the idea of a pool of apps which all count towards a time budget. 
 
     Yes, that was our experience. Apple seems to have tools, but they allow so many workarounds it ends up
    being pointless. My ten year olds screen time is down to two hours a day for the last seven days. Thats
    all I wanted.   She and I played frisbee at the park for an hour today, no way that happens two weeks ago.



 Good to know.  We've had a great experience so far with Qustodio so far, though
- we didn't install it on a PC or Mac, which is maybe the huge difference
here... on several iPhones and an iPad though, it was hiccup-free, and
Qustodio's installation instructions were clear.  Maybe iOS version and device
age play a role as well, but just offering that up for consideration.  Also:
>OurPact instead focuses on time, not content policing  I've mentioned this
elsewhere here and I've been clear lately that I believe in ""parenting is not a
monolith"" and ""parental controls vary based on your family situation.""  In our
family, content policing is still a bit needed, and Qustodio is catching all
kinds of crazy stuff they are trying to look for.  So I've been quite pleased on
that front.  >Apple’s built-in Screen Time doesn’t do the job  We're using a
combo of Qustodio and Screen Time on our kids devices; Screen Time in our case
(again, ""varies based on family situation"") has been doing a great job in
allowing the kids to reach us while not messaging their friends until 3AM, which
they've happily done, to their detriment, when given the opportunity.  I know
there's the sentiment in this sub that kids can and will circumvent literally
everything, but ours haven't yet defeated the Screen Time layer and Downtime
associated.  They might not be heavily motivated, though, because we leave Apple
Music and lots of the other apps (no social media) up and running that they also
like, for a bit longer.  But I'm sure everything changes on a Mac.  I think the
majority of successful Parental Control-defeating instructions here start with
""so you're going to need a Mac or PC.""  Thank you for posting your experience
with these products!

Turning off “share across devices” means nothing. BS still syncs across devices.

For some reason he is able to use the old screen time passcode to unlock apps.
How do we fix this?

 idk maybe try changing the password again  or have a talk with him  also, how
old is he? 
 


 I think the easiest path is grabbing the iPad when he's away from it and
changing it on the iPad directly.  I've had this happen before and no clue why
or how, but it typically means that the device isn't successfully communicating
with your parent device for whatever reason.  If it's an iPad, make sure you're
both on the same Wifi network while making the change.  You can visually verify
in Screen Time when the iPad last checked in / reported status if you open the
child's account from within your parent screen time settings.

MAC Screen Time Bypass- Help me,"MAC Screen Time Bypass- Help me

I need a way to download apps on mac, but my mom has screen time restrictions,
the default apple restrictions, and she can just check what apps i have, and
what time i spend on any apps. So, basically, the thing is, how do I first,
download ANY apps I want that she doesn't want without her being notified, and
secondly, use those apps without her being able to check and see?

 You can try changing the name of the app I guess. 
 
     could work, but considering i gotta actually download the app first, fails at the first step.



 There is a way to download apps, not App Store ones though. Some apps dont work
with this method either. The method is: double click on the dmg as usual, then
when it tells you to put the app in the applications folder, put it on the
desktop instead.  
 
     I have another one. Open it and instead of double clicking select show package contents. There will be in
    some folder and inside it a black rectangle double click it. Even allows multiple simountalous instances.



 just take their phone or ipad or anything under their apple id and click “change
screen time passcode” and then “remove passcode” and all you need to know is the
device’s password, not the screen time passcode, then it will allow you to press
“ignore limit” on any app thats limited and you can change any settings you want
from your device

How to bypass apple screen time parental controls?,"How to bypass apple screen time parental controls?

Here are the steps on how to bypass apple screen time parental controls:  Step
1: Think before you want to buy a new iphone  Step 2: Go to the apple store
Step 3: If u have a lot of money, then buy the latest iphone series like the
iphone 17 series  Step 4: After you just got a new iphone, just set it up  Step
5: While you set up your new iphone, create a new apple account  Step 6: While
you create a new apple account, just put a random birthdate like a birthdate
over 18+ example: I put my birthdate on my apple account to 9 august 2002  Step
7: after you just finish creating new ur apple account and finish setup, ur done
and now you have freedom to use iphone like no screen time and unrestricted
access

 Or, if the reset code option is available on your device, just enter your own
(four digit) passcode, click cancel, and change whatever you want. Might be
patched, but it worked the last time I tried it.

hi i'm nearly 16 and i have a 2 hour time limit put on my phone daily. i'd be
less bothered by this if it actually worked the way it's meant to. about 30
minutes into using my phone and it already says '5 minutes remaining for all
apps and categories'. i do have this limit shared across devices but more than
half the time i haven't even used any other devices that day. how do i fix this?

 I would make sure you have no background apps running. I know some of the
crappier parental control software's can count apps that are running in the
background as if they were actively being used.  Also what parental control app
do they use?

My 15 yo son think I am too strict when it comes to screen time.,"My 15 yo son think I am too strict when it comes to screen time.

Hello,  I have a 15 year old that thinks I am restricting him when it comes to
online time. Things worked quite well until about a year ago when we bought him
a new pc with Windows 11. This allowed him to randomize his network mac address,
thus defeating our Circle parental controls. We have used Apple family controls
and Microsoft parental controls in combination with Circle. Also some Apple
updates brought with them private mac adresses.    During weekdays he can use
his devices from 7-23, and weekends 7-24, and some times even later. He is
allowed to use all apps, games, and there is no restriction on websites like
discord, YouTube and such.    He is always using either on the pc, or watching
YouTube on his phone. He still complains, and even broke the MS parental
controls. He filmed me logging into the admin account, and stole the password
there. He even left the Microsoft family a couple of times. I talked him back.
He randomized his devices mac adresses to avoid the parental controls. He says
his friends can stay up until 3-4 in the morning, and still make school. He has
overslept a couple of times and come late to school getting remarks for that.
During summer vacation he has been up until early morning, and been sleeping
during the day. He says I am a failed parent and ridicules me for being too
strict with him.    I have invested in a new mesh router system now, and started
to enforce only mac approved devices on the network. I have adjusted his age so
he is unable to leave the family in case of a tantrum. I have taken back control
of the admin rights on his pc and will enable the Microsoft family feature.
We really struggle. We as as parents have to stay up until he is in bed. Ideally
I would say 22 (10 pm) should be the lates on a weekday for him to be on the pc.
When it comes to weekends I am not that concerned. Have I been too lenient with
him? Is he a totally spoiled brat? Have I failed as a parent?    I have tried
talking to him, saying as parents we only want the best for him, and there needs
to be limits. As a teenager he need sleep, minimum 8 hours each day. And if we
do not enforce limits he will stay up like forever, even if he promise us he
will go to bed. As long as he lives with us, and uses the stuff we pay for he
needs to follow the rules. and the rules are always too strict according to him.
I need advice on how to put things right. Both from parents, and from someone
his viewpoint and age. Thanks!

 Mate, you're doing the right thing. When I was your sons age, I did exactly the
same thing with my friends. When I have kids, they gonna be playing  outside and
climbing trees, not stuck on devices 
 
     He has matured a bit now. And even found and read this thread on his own. I believe he has realized I was
    not unreasonable. He told me just a few days ago he really needed those family controls when he was
    younger like 9 or 12. But not now he says. I am not entirely convinced though. But he is on a longer leash
    now, thats for sure.



 I am a little younger than your son, i have 3h 30m daily, i can occasionally get
an extra 30 mins. While i have my mood swings and think that this is way too
strict for me, it has definetly helped me get over addictions and stuff. I'd say
that it's not good that he has no screen time limits, i get it if it's during
the summer break but outside of that, he should probably not have basically
unlimited time. Once you actually put more limits on him, he will get really
pissed, since he has had it so easy for so long.  Lastly, beware of
u/citizen_of_gmil this person universally hates all parents for no clear reason
and might come here to ridicule you. 
 
     I appreciate your valuable insight, Mr. 13yo! And thanks for the mention – I'm flattered. Now go back to
    listening in your middle school class. Wouldn't want your beloved mommy and daddy to be mad at you.

     [removed]



 hes just a bum, these are the most generous and lenient restrictions ive ever
seen. 
 


 If he stays up, it means he will get in trouble at school if he falls asleep,
right? Let him face real consequences. Natural consequences are always the best
teachers. He should be able to understand what his responsibilities are.  I
stayed up all night when I was a teen reading fics and scrolling Wikipedia, and
honestly, I was responsible enough to do that. All homework done, not falling
asleep in school and all that. If he can pull it off, then it shouldn’t be a
problem. 
 
     I remember just following links for hours on PC as a teen. I'd regularly go 2 days without sleep. All
    night on Xbox or laptop then school at 9am.... Those where good time I'm lucky if I can do 12 hours now
    without a old man nap and I'm only in my 30s XD.  My advice is the same my mum and dad had. You get up for
    school. Do well at school you can have all the screen time you want. It's a deal I'm sure they regretted
    but you won't believe the amount of stuff I absorbed from the internet.... That said these days there's
    that much fake stuff around I'm not sure if let any child near social media. You want to talk to friends
    Skype them,... Or MSN messenger in my case



 These are absolutely lenient measures. This is neither a matter of „your
failure“ or him being a „spoiled brat“.  Think back to your time in highschool -
status is basically everything. Having parental controls on devices is certainly
seen as embarrassing (own experience). What I think is happening is he is being
singled out due to not being able to stay up as late as the others. This is not
a failure on your part, the difference is just 30 years ago you were uncool if
you wouldn’t sneak out at 1am, now it’s if you can’t come online at 1.  Even if
he is not being bullied, seeing your friends the same age play a lot and have
fun and you can never be there can be really frustrating.  You certainly just
have a case of frustration and puberty on your hands. There is no clear fix for
this but get on a level with your son - understand why he wants to stay up late
and level on certain things you could allow him. His end goal is having no
restrictions. This will happen at some point but certainly not now.  Meeting
somewhere while still standing on a certain limit (e.g. not more than 6 hours a
day, not after a certain time) is your best bet here.  Children at the age of
14-17 are reaaaally good at hurting their parents. Don’t pay attention to the
„failed parent“ bs. They don’t mean it, they regret it after saying it and it
will stop.  Funnily, i hear my brother and parents arguing about to word the
exact same thing right now. 
 


 * **Under 2 years old:** Zero screen time, except for video chatting with family
or friends * **2-5 years old:** No more than one hour per day co-viewing with a
parent or sibling * **5-17 years old:** Generally no more than two hours per
day, except for homework  **Source:** osfhealthcare.org/blog/kids-screen-time-
how-much-is-too-much 
 


 I remember how I felt when I was 16 and stills had parental controls, it was
embarrassing and, I was quite mature, but I to this day think they were no
longer necessary. When I was 8 years old, definitely. 12, probably. 14, maybe?
But by 15 and 16 I knew I really didn’t need them. I asked my parents
respectfully (which was difficult because I really, really, really hated the
parental controls), and we agreed on a solution to scale the controls down
gradually as I showed that I didn’t need them anymore until there were no more.
Being older now, I realise the parent’s perspective on why parental controls
were a good idea when I was younger but by the time I could manage myself
maturely in terms of emotions and judgements like going to bed on time, doing
homework, etc., I knew they were obsolete. It’s up to how mature you trust him
to be. If you think it’s okay for him to manage himself because he’s shown
maturity, they’re not necessary anymore, but if he has shown repeatedly (very
recently, don’t take experience from months or years ago) that he is immature,
then you may still need them.   Very long comment, haha 
 


 Here I understand both sides. Think of it like this though: Your son may have
friends from other countries, in different timezones. To play with these
friends, he may need to join late at night, especially in the weekends. He also
may have an essay, due for the next day, which he forgot about and so needs to
write it, potentially late into the night.  What you should do is ask him what
HE wants, and explain that you can't see anything he does other than when the
computer is being used. Try make a compromise together. Maybe, reward him for a
month of good behaviour, with a new game or something similar. 
 


 > he doesn't believe in school (?)  > he will get a 4g modem  > (personal
opinion) especially by using technical means, they feel controlled, I would use
reason-> result discouragement
(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)) 
 
     The more you oppress people the more they will revoult



 Maybe come to a compromise so he can have later on weekends and still have it
until 11pm on school nights?

I have a iPad, I don’t have limits on anything except games. I can’t install a

mobile games. I can’t turn off screen time with Apple ID cuz configs are
enabled, banning me from signing out and also banning me from changing time
zone.  Anyone have ideas about how to bypass apple screeen time, I know there
should be a way, it is extremely buggy, sometimes showing as time limited, but I
can still access the app. And my parents cannot be reasoned with, they are very
strict on screen time, only allowing access from 2-4pm.   p.s. how to remove the
configs???

 I know a bypass, but it'll take a few hours, and it might not even work. I used
it on my phone, but you have to be stupidly persistent and desperate if you
really want to make it work.  Go to settings, general, then scroll all the way
down  tap on ""reset"",  then ""erase all content and settings"".  Enter the
password, and from here you can start brute forcing screen time passcodes.  I
think and hope your screen time passcode is 4 digits, if it's 6, RIP.  You do
have infinite attempts at this, and if you do succeed, there is a confirmation
button I think (or you can cancel the resetting).  If you have any questions,
please let me know     However, this is a very stupid and time consuming brute-
force method. Best of luck to you.

 You should just cut down on Snapchat. Instead, you could learn a new skill or

     Just Snapchat? TikTok as well. This is way too much time on a phone. I work 10 hours a day, he was on his

     Lol 🤣 why tho? *edit * uh nvm 46 HOURS 💀💀💀



 Yes, do literally anything else, learn an instrument or go for a walk, find a
trail near your suburb to take a walk to down, touch grass, sit outside, meet up
with your friends, just do anything that isn't on a screen for a few hours a
day. 
 
     This. I used to have 10 hours daily screen time then I started playing guitar, which cut me down to like 4
    hours and most of that is just looking at tabs for songs

 No girls whatsoever but you’re not allowed to move out until married? That makes
sense.  Strict is a big understatement. 
 
     my parents will find a girl for me

     Mine were kinda like that in that aspect too. No dating allowed, focus on school. Cool, okay. A few years
    later (still in college) they start asking me why I don't have a girlfriend, cause whatever neighbour is
    already getting married or is having a baby 😅🤣  Developing your social skills is an important part of
    growing up. Wish they understood that, maybe I wouldn't be so awkward today 🤣



 Prison rules christ, my parents trust me not be an idiot and let me do my own
thing idk 
 
     For real lmao it's like   - Dont die (optional)

     Same here. This above.

     Yup, my mom says, don't die, don't do something you'll regret, and do all your work. The last one is the
    only challenging one.

     Mom doesn't trust me to walk.  Dad lets me shoot a gun with no one around (cause he knows I'm not an idiot
    and that I am extra cautious)

     I think they're a little too strict /j (I'm saying that like my parents let me do that)

     My parents didn't like how much of a home body I am and encouraged me to go drinking and clubbing as a
    teen 💀💀

     Absolutely prison rules. This is insane. I'm a 34 year old mother to a 9 year old son, and even I don't do
    this to him at his age.  u/BMWequalsMercedes, this isn't just strict, this is abuse. At least borderline
    abuse.  This is so messed up and I feel terrible for you. I am so sorry you have to go through this. My
    heart breaks for you.

     i had it easier in prison

     Exactly bro

     ""Drive safe don't rape""

     Facts

     Right 😅

     Yeah, same. They trusted me to make my own mistakes and then come to them if I needed help. Which, I did.
    And that was a lot more productive for me than whatever the hell this bullshit is.   This guy is one year
    younger than me at most going off of his flair, yet it feels like they’re treating him like a 7 year old
    with their first iPad. Not a nearly grown person capable of having a job or making their own decisions.

     Yeah I swear bless this kind of parents😭

     Lol same

     Some prisoners get more freedom holy shit

     Prisons have better rules than those

     Prison is less strict than this.

     Even if you had been an idiot, some natural consequences are vital to healthy development

     My parents have limits, like don’t die, and try not to stay up after 9. But like idc and they don’t care
    so ehh

     😂 my rules are like • don’t die • don’t do stupid crap



 You living in an asylum wtf 😭😭 
 
     you wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised HIM

     I thought mine were strict but after reading this I literally hugged my mam 😭

     Aslume??!!

     no bro. when I was in one there was literally the same puzzle to do everyday, and 2 activities that no one
    attended besides the host. We had a tv but it only had YouTube and Netflix, and YouTube was restricted to
    only safe content. We also weren’t allowed to hold the control so we had to ask them to change what we
    were watching. We got to go outside occasionally for 30-45 minutes, but only a couple of us at a time so
    it took a little for you to be in rotation. No phones, no shoes, and no strings(including those that hold
    your pants up).  not gonna lie tho, cause I was in a psychosis it is literally an amazing memory. Besides
    the breakdowns from thinking my family was dead, and limited food.

     i genuinley have been in the mental hospital twice and this isnt much of an understatement

     [deleted]

     The aslume

     Aslume? Alsume? Fucking stupid?

     What the FUCK is the asylum? I only know the ASLUME!



 Yeah. Beyond strict.  Sounds like they don't trust you one bit, and a good
portion of the list sounds like what most teens would get if they're grounded or
receiving other form of punishment.  Have you ever done *anything* that would
make them want to do this? 
 
     no man my parents were raised strict so ig they decided i gotta be raised strict too

     This is definitely beyond strict. I'm strict on my kids, and this makes me look like a saint. Granted, I
    would be less strict if they didn't try and take a mile whenever I give them an inch.



 if i were you i would just throw my phone away already

 Your parents definitely have a problem. They're essentially taking away your
teenage years for God knows why. 
 
     my mum said when she was growing up she wasnt allowed to go to college n shi



 If this is real then move out when you're 18 
 
     And while you're at it, cut them off too

     Honestly

     Guess join the military And Feel like these are the kind of parents would kick  him out once he’s 18
    anyway so he have to be prepared.

     Honestly, just from this, it seems like it will be very difficult for OP to do, just based off this list,
    I doubt they would let them get a job to be able to afford moving out

     its not that easy where will he live

     Probably going to be complicated, these kind of parents won't let you learn independence at all. They
    probably will even punish you if they see that you started planning on moving. I speak from experience

How to bypass Screen Time? It's kinda frustrating.,"How to bypass Screen Time? It's kinda frustrating.

So for context I'm 16 with 2 control freak sort of parents, and when i got my
iphone when i was 13, they put screen time on it. When I checked it out, they
gave me an hour. I didn't question it, but even now, 3 months after my 16th bday
they still haven't given me any extra time. I feel that 1 hour is a bit short
compared to many of my friends, so I was wondering, is there any way to find the
screen time passcode without having a convo with them or using 3rd party apps or
restarting my phone? My model's an IPhone 11 btw. Would appreciate help with
finding the STP, especially if its something my parents wouldn't find out about.

 Okay this is how I bypassed mine but it might take some time and dedication. So
firstly, go to settings, general, transfer or reset phone, click erase all
content and settings, press continue, and it'll ask you for ur phone pass so put
it in, then it'll ask u for the screentime password so ur gonna go here :
[https://www.deviantart.com/l33tn3rdz/art/All-possible-4-digit-PIN-
Numbers-0000-9999-hax-436606629](https://www.deviantart.com/l33tn3rdz/art/All-
possible-4-digit-PIN-Numbers-0000-9999-hax-436606629)  And that is basically a
list of all possible 4 digit combinations. Your gonna have to try every single
one of these until you get the screentime pin your parents put. Now, if you do
it like this, it shouldn't make you ""wait 5 minutes to try again"" and stuff
after getting it wrong a lot, you should be able to do it as many times as you
want and eventually you'll get the screentime pin and will be able to change ur
screentime settings but be careful and don't forget to change them back to how
they were originally before when ur done so your parents don't find out you know
the password. And dont worry your phone won't be erased because after you put in
the screentime password it asks for ur apple ID password so at that point you
can simply just go back.   This is all coming from someone who also has
controlling parents so I can relate to the struggle 
 
     Doesn’t that alert the parents tho?

     i dont have my apple id password tho bc my parents are just that controlling. thanks for your tip! i will
    use this as a last resort... lol

     How did you get it to not lock you out after failed attempts?

     [removed]

     did it work for you on ios 18? i heard they added silent limit on 17 it works tested

     There is 100,000 possible combinations bro how dedicated were you

     If u get the password right will it delete of your phone?

     ok, lo sapevo, ma cosa serve la lista? pensi sappia contare

     Currently doing this rn, do u have any tips this takes foreverrrr im at 2200

     it's asking me to erase my phone without asking for my screen time....i'm scared is it supposed to be like
    that???

     Thank god for this bro I have fiteen minutes a day except for settings messages and camera and I have
    communication limits

     Does it work on ios 18.5 tho??

     :(  Tried but it wasn’t the right code. Got the code, just wouldn’t work for some reason…

     It only asked for my iPhone passcode not screent time, I’m afraid it will wipe the data

     I got locked out for 1 minute after 6 attempts

     THANK YOU SO MUCH IT WORKED AFTER 1019 TRIES

     But when I try, I have to wait 5 min, 15 min, 30min and so on

     Uh struggling teen here - how long is this supposed to take…?

     hey so each time i have to wait 60 min is that normal cuz i have like 19 atempts

     Начал только что написал уже 0168, по расчетам мне понадобится 60 листов так что удачи мне

     Since there is roughly 6000 for you to try, and it will take you about an hour to put the codes in non
    stop, and that will only do a third of it, idk if you would want to spend 3 hours just putting codes that
    might not even work (6k+) unless you are THAT dedicated.

     wouldnt erase all content just delete everything on ur phone?

     I’m pretty sure that if you put the wrong code in too many times it will have you wait 5 mins.

     Does this method still work or has it been patched?

     bro thnk you for ts

     The easiest thing to do is just take your parents phone and reset the passcode and if they ask questions
    just act dumb thats if your parents aren't a tech genius



 facetime a friend and share you screen have them control it and it should work
forever and have sound (unlike assistive acess and its normal) 
 
     hi, just tried this with a friend. it worked! tysmm

     Could you please explain a little better I don’t rlly understand



 If anyone is reading this thread, just keep reading. Something here will help. 
 


 1 minute per day bro😭 
 
     one minute of youtube and snapchat a day, 0 seconds of tiktok, and yet my younger sister has no limits 😭

     oh nah💀

     RHATS WORSE THAN ME DAYUM

     Same I have that too in desperate ash



 i know you can do it with android phones but not sure about iphones, but if its
an app they have installed you could in theory plug it into a computer, browse
the phone files and just delete the app. this may not work because its ios and
not android, it would probably work with a macbook though 
 


 You can change your time zone if it’s dependent on that, or you can reset your
Apple ID password which enables you to change or reset the Screen Time Code,
it’s under setting and ICloud I think. Or you talk to your parents lol 
 


 anyone know how i reset it so it looks i haven gon on my phone 
 


 Wait only one hour 
 
     yep, unfortunately.



 So basically if it's the built in Screen Time that apple uses, you can delete
the app and when you refresh screen time it says you've been on your phone for X
amount of time but it doesn't register for any apps. 
 
     i’ve seen this kind of advice before. unfortunately, i can’t uninstall apps. thanks tho!



 If you FaceTime someone(someone you trust) you can share your screen and they
have to press the bottom right button to ask for remote access and wait a bit
and it should deactivate temporarily. I’m not sure for how long but you can
repeat this 
 
     can it work if u do it on messages or only on facetime?

     Facebook age verification system detects 96% of teenagers trying to set age over 18 according to them.

     Tiktok actually guesses your age based on the content you watch and bans you if you try to manually change
    it

     Tin foil hat - is there strategy to getting a user-base to do this? Can you charge more to advertisers?

 [Full article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64813981)  >If young people
hit the new limit, they will have to enter a passcode to continue to use the
service that day. But they will be able to opt out of the new measure, which
TikTok says will be rolled out ""in the coming weeks"".  So it makes fuck all of a
difference, really. 
 
     Yea it can definitely be easily bypassed, but something is better than nothing? Idk, wishful thinking ig

     dont they already suggest you take a break every 5 minutes? people just gonna straight up ignore it

     It’s just to assuage Karen and helicopter parents, give them an answer to their kids phone addictions. As
    if it’s not their fault.

     This might work for parents setting screen time for younger kids, but tbh they probably shouldn’t be on
    TikTok in the first place

     That's a shame, I felt like this really could've been impactful on reducing the negative effects of a
    platform like TikTok. Then again why would they wanna do that unless they had to?

     Is the passcode from them or parents?

     This should be higher

     Just get rid of it completely lmao

     Ofc they have to add this feature or else people would stop using their app.....they care about minors but
    bo the the point that they will be in a loss

     But what's the pass code? Maybe it's set by their parents? Or themselves? Lol

     i mean i don't think they would really do much, because that would drive down engagement



 I dont even use tiktok but thats awesome 
 
     I'm surprised people would even spend more than on hour that

     They do it so that kids say they are 18+ in an easy lie and then ads are less regulated and they can make
    more scratch.

     It's useless. It just tells you that it's been an hour and you just re-enter your password to continue.

     not awesome enough  40 mins for under 13, we need that

     Lmao agreed

     r/beatmetoit

     I’ve been torn on this the last couple days.   Cons are it’s a Chinese spy platform and a lot of kids and
    adults do stupid fucking shit for fame on there.   Pros are there are also lots of people who use Tik Tok
    as an information platform or to help others like in the case of the Asian couple who were harassed by a
    racist and she used her exposure there to shine a light on others who have been ignored by the media and
    lawmakers.   I don’t personally use it but I do wish that a U.S. dev could replicate a similar platform to
    roll out so people would be more protected…lol who am I lying to. The US spies on us just as much as China
    does.   Guys don’t do stupid Tik tok challenges. That’s my biggest concern and then it’s the world
    governments spying on us.

     Same lol

     haha yes, glory to the people's republic, what massacre at Tiananmen square.

     I think it's an hour too long, but a step in the right direction.



 Good, that site destroys attention span so quickly. happened to one of my
friends and she can’t even have a proper conversation with me anymore 
 
     Not even just teenagers. I’m 32 and it’s happened to a few people close to me. Cant write more than a few
    sentences in a text before they moan about my ‘essays’ and they never bother reading them.  Some TikTok
    trends have completely changed their way of thinking too, the way social media especially TikTok
    influences society is really concerning.

     That's just sad honestly.

     That's such a weird argument. I have a horrible attention span. That's also why I hardly use tiktok,
    because I don't want to watch a 30 second video at normal speed without being able to do something else on
    my phone.

     Are you fucking kidding me?! I've never had a good attention span despite never having been to TikTok,
    which is why I have trouble studying most of the time.

     [removed]

     You saying and recognizing this problem at 14 gives me faith in someone in this generation, along with
    everyone who agrees with you. Please, for the love of God, you are the hope of your age group. Don't ever
    fall in this battle

     The video lengths are longer than vine, Instagram. What do you mean?

     Scrollimg through Reddit or Insta also destroys your attention span...

     I’ve always had that problem and I didn’t even have TikTok till a few months ago

     Can’t have a normal conversation? What do you mean by that?

     Seriously, I helped my friend fly out for spring break (split 200 between 3 ppl) and the dude spent the
    entire time on tik tok. He made me put dubs on for animes so he could listen and use his phone, and even
    then obviously didn’t pay attention (“was she bullied by him” while watching A Silent Voice)

     Same goes for my dad + there’s a shit ton of conspiracy theorists in his feed an he’s basically
    brainwashing himself like for the covid vaccine, despite my mom went through 9 years of medicine
    university w top grades he doesn’t even trust her saying that the vaccines are safe, this kind of content
    is just ruining people

     we can't continue to pin this on individuals as if they are able to exist outside of a sociological
    landscape, and we have to hold technology companies accountable for enabling technology addiction through
    the way that phones and computers are currently organized.  ""If we want to cure technology addiction and
    reclaim our attention, we have to fix our phones and computers so as to require a small but non-zero
    amount of conscious input so as to engage with stimuli. by doing so, we can begin to heal from this
    epidemic that has seriously damaged our society over the last decade and a half: self-harm as a result of
    instagram obsession, death and injury as a result of distracted driving, political polarization and an
    inability to compromise as a result of the ability to costlessly obtain confirmation from others, and many
    many more."" https://giacomocatanzaro.substack.com/p/pop-music-pornography

     Happened to a friend of mine, we were walking in a group of 6 people and there was a crossroad which we
    had to turn at, and bro was staring at his phone the entire time and just walked forward, so we just let
    him be until 10 minutes later he called us and asked where we were.

     Same. I can barely finish a game of chess without checking my phone at this point.

     I can talk to my GF for a total of like 5 minutes before the phone comes out and the dopamine cats are
    back. Mildly infuriating because I don't even touch my phone unless it's work related.

     Nah, that’s a myth: https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790.amp  Social media is damaging, but it won’t
    make your attention span any shorter, it is not even a well-defined term. What is more likely is that
    simple old reading a book, studying, or having a conversation will just become boring to the given person
    from the instant gratification. But if they find something they care about deeply they won’t have trouble
    concentrating.

     Apparently they have to have like 3 different things (often family guy, subway surfers, and the actual
    content) at the same time to keep people engaged. They're sub one minute videos and people can't pay
    attention.

     bro says it on reddit and probably has insta lmao



 Flexes in 18yo  And not having tiktok because fuck that 
 
     I'm with you sir. PROUDLY

     Imagine shitting on TikTok while using Reddit lmao

     Never downloaded that

     People really think it’s a personality trait to not have TikTok😂

     Stopped using it a year ago, never made a better decision before. My attention span is back and I'm so
    much happier.

     Not having tik tok cause it's banned here

     \*suffers in instagram reels and youtube shorts\*



 Tiktok making good updates? 
 
     They just tryna not get banned in the US

     Guess they'll need to cram 30 times the corruption into one hour

     Try Lomotif!  Just updated today.  Much better than TikTok



 FOR THOSE WONDERING. You can turn it off effectively making their efforts
useless. Im pretty sure everyone is going to turn that off 
 
     Exactly.

     also pretty sure almost everybody sets their age over 18 so that makes it even more useless

     Bruh android already can set timers for apps? Why would you need that?



 Should be 0 
 
     The correct answer

     Reddit and hating tiktok name a more iconic combo

     Correct

     I use TikTok and Reddit and what’s funny is that Reddit makes fun of TikTok and TikTok makes fun of
    Reddit. Like Redditor is literally used as an insult

     Yes

     Jesus its not that bad  Edit: for those who are downvoting me, please i would like to know why you hate
    tiktok so much, reddit isnt much better yknow

     Gonna go watch tik tok now

     hello? Based department?



 Does anyone even actually use their real birthday online unless they’re actually
18? 
 
     I do because when you set it under 18 companies are required to not track me as im underage following EU

     I use the same birthday, just not the same birth year



 Tiktok be like ""fine, I'll do it myself""

Here’s mine to start :3

 around 5 hours  It can be as low as 2 hours, and as high as 9, but generally 4
hours and 30 minutes is the average 
 


 too much 
 
     Yeah, I’m a bit embarrassed about it to be honest :p



 Would be more if my mom didn’t put time limits on my phone. On school nights
it’s 9:30 and on weekends/summer 10:30  It’s fair to me cause otherwise I would
definitely be on my phone all night (I have to take meds just to fall asleep)
but still annoying lol  She also hardly lets me have social media. Again I don’t
care, it’s mostly crappy anyway. Idc about snap, insta, whatever. But I do want
TikTok. All I have is Pinterest and Reddit  I still can’t believe I’m in high
school and I have ts ;-; 
 


 This made me realize I didn’t have that setting on, so I don’t know 
 
     It’s In battery lol



 idk cuz i don't have a phone so i can't check 
 


 Mine looks something like:  SoundCloud: 1h 30m - 3h per every 3 days or so a
week.  Discord: 30m once every month or so  Google: on Avg. no more than 10m
Reddit: is a special case, because I open Reddit most exclusively on my Laptop
or PC, but normally I spend around 1h 30m - 3h 1-2 days of the week depending on
how busy my schedule is and whether I find myself in an infinite loop of looking
at posts and commenting or just upvoting any good samaritan.

Goodbye boys It’s been a long one (No I’m not turning 20),"Goodbye boys It’s been a long one (No I’m not turning 20)

Ok so I’m gonna get straight to the point. Most of my devices are gone. With
them my half finished CoD battle pass and Apex skins and hundreds of other
random things I was proud of but my parents would never understand. Over the
past years screens have become an escape for me. 2 hours a day is all I asked
but that was too much for my parents.  I have managed to salvage my phone for a
while before it is taken away too. I can delete reddit off my phone but I know
my parents will search messages and find this if I say this to my friends there.
I don’t know when I’ll be getting stuff back but in all seriousness it may not
even be till I’m 18. 4 years is gonna feel like an eternity.   To my friends,  I
know you have reddit and are on r/teenagers  If there is a small chance you see
this then I have some stuff to explain.  I’ve had a disagreement with my parents
over something as trivial as a Spelling Bee. They can’t trust that I put effort
into everything I do. They can’t trust that I don’t spend the whole day in front
of screens. I don’t feel like I can talk to them anymore. I don’t feel like they
support my ambitions or want to let me be a kid. I feel like the bar they’ve set
for me is in the sky and I’m just an ant.   I might be being babyish. Or
overreacting. But the bottom line is I may not be able to see you guys unless
it’s at school for a while. A long while. I’m probably gonna sit in my room most
of the time. I don’t know why my parents think this will do any good. I don’t
know what to do to fix my relationship with them.  But whatever the case I’ll be
offline for a while boys. Go get that Tactical Nuke for me would you?l  And I
know how dangerous it is to give names out online but, it’s me,   So until
better days come, see you on the other side dudes.  ✌️  Edit: Homies thank you
so much. This post got enough attention that my friend saw it and messaged me.
The way it’s looking now I’ll be losing my phone tomorrow. I’m working something
out with my friend about him taking care of my Reddit account. Update coming
soon if you want it, but by the day after tomorrow I will be gone from Reddit
for a while. Again, thank you everyone!  Anyways I’m gonna go sleep dudes. See
ya  Edit 2: [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ijc4b4/im_still

 I understand what are you passing by. I'm not on that stage yet but I think my
relationship with my family is starting to turn towards this path and getting to
be like yours one day. Good luck, let's hope your parents can change their own
minds soon. 
 
     A little tip from one teen with helicopter parents to the other: don’t act like you’re hiding things, and
    if you are, delete whatever it is ASAP. Don’t wait, because the next hour could be an explosive
    conversation where they want to go through your whole phone :’)

     Another tip from someone with helicopter parents: you should probably delete your apps once you're done
    using them. use IG and Reddit on the browser if possible. You never know when they might take your device
    for inspection

     This post made me almost tear up, my father is exactly like this. For some reason he can't stand the fact
    I'm not exactly like him even tho we are 50 years of age apart

 I’m gonna be there when you come back mate. Even if it is 4 years it’s the best
thing I can do. 
 
     there's a remind me link some of us clicked it's for 4 years. hopefully my reddit will still be active by
    then

     Nah you realistically will forget this

     Youve been reminded



 I feel your pain brother. My step mom abused me for 3 years (not letting me
shower, not giving me clothes, feeding me nothing but white bread for days,
making me crawl through mud, as well as denying me any kind of internet access
of course.) I was eventually able to get her to surrender custody to my mom, now
ive got a car and 2000 in the bank. I guess my point is, pain is temporary, keep
your head up homie 
 
     Im pretty sure what your step mom did is against the law

     Damn, I would have smashed her head in after a week, u r a kind eggplant.

     Me who hasn't showered in two weeks:   (Its satire please stop bullying my useless internet point count)



 Good luck man (Not a friend, just a stranger just in case) I know it might seem
hard but eventually the time will be up, and you'll get stuff back. Don't wait
for it. It'll come, but not if you want it to. 
 


 Do NOT delete the account, just eliminate Reddit and keep the password and the
username, then your parents won't see anything

     ik im a little dumb 😅 

     also side note i love how everyone collectively decided i was a girl besides never specifying any gender 

     those went extinct since the day of our tyrant, technoblade

     My first thought lol

     My boy what nerd reads comics

     That is NOT a nerd. That is someone who is nerdy, but that is far better than a nerd.

     Honestly I (37potato) never could differentiate, we all have our niches, but we all kind of fit like some
    dysfunctionally functional family...and that's just how life is ❤️ (also, yes, there are the die hard
    haters in each...henk them)

     Are you perchance, a bookworm and studious? From your cerebral cortex to your gluteus?



 Fire take not weird at all 
 
     Says the loser lol

     [deleted]



 mfs go ""I love nerdy losers"" and what they refer to is people with hobbies who
aren't afraid to share them  /j 
 
     i re read this now and i know it sounds like i’m calling people who do all this stuff losers but i
    honestly meant it in the best way possible   this was mostly towards one guy who i have feelings forwho is
    definitely a loser (we joke about it) and that’s most of the reason i said that 😅



 Bcs I watch anime im a loser now-? Crazy. 
 
     i kinda realize this now but this was kinda directed towards one guy and he’s definitely a loser i’m not
    really trying to call everyone who watches anime a loser!! sorry!!

     Us anime watchers are GOATS ngl 💅💅



 I prefer to be referred to as a nerd 
 
     yea a lot of people have mentioned that but i swear i didn’t mean loser in a derogatory way (this post was
    mostly about a boy i like and he calls himself a loser)

     I thought nerds were smart, while weebs or geeks or something were people with ""weird"" interests



 Nah youre right but I wouldnt call em loosers, just people with interests 
 


 Thats not a loser, thats a geek 
 


 I wouldn't call this loser, rather nerd. I was on the receiving end of this tho
lol.   Talk to my ex girlfriend, she'll totally agree with you xD 
 


 Loser = No social skills, probably emotionally unstable, makes you uncomfortable
Nerd/Geek = What you described 
 
     Inaccurate tbh. A nerd is not the same as a geek. [See image for simplified venn
    diagram](https://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Geek-Nerd-Dork.jpg)

     lol sorry 😅

     Damn so I’m a loser and a bit of a nerd



 dawg do you know what a loser is? 
 
     yes, i didn’t mean loser in a derogatory way i was talking about a boy who considers himself as a loser
    and i dont really know better! sorry!!

My school accidentally played porn during our opening assembly.,"My school accidentally played porn during our opening assembly.

I am not making this shit up.  So during our school’s opening assembly today,
they were playing a PowerPoint (like all assemblies) to update us on all the new
covid rules. Thing is, during the presentation, their computer crapped out. One
of the tech people offered to hook up their laptop to the display and continue
the presentation, so they hook it up and now we just have to wait for that
laptop to be sent the presentation. The administrator sending it asks the guy to
enter the outlook program, but I guess he misclicked or something as immediately
after he clicks hardcore MFM porn plays on the big screen in front of the entire
10th grade. Most people start losing their shit and the teachers started to
panic. It only played for about five seconds (five very graphic seconds btw)
before he stops it being completely red in the face. It legit took about two
minutes to calm the entire school down and continue. The worst part was that the
school just continued with the assembly as normal like nothing happened, even
though everyone just watched a completely non-PG threesome.  What even is the
education system anymore.  Update: The school just sent everyone an email saying
that they are “horrified” by the incident and have taken “steps” so that this
won’t happen again. They also said in the email that pornography is completely
prohibited on school grounds and that if any more porn is played they’ll be
dishing out suspensions. Pretty hyped to see what happens on Monday lol.

 It would take a lot more than 2 minutes to calm my school down lmao 
 
     It'll take forever to calm down my school after that. LITERALLY FOREVER

     Mine would take 15 minutes at least

     It would take a very long time to calm just one yeargroup of my school down 😂 I'm in second year (9th
    grade for you Americans and others) and we're crazy as it is

     I remember in 7th grade the religion teacher said something about sex and the class went berserk for the
    rest of the session (about 20 minutes) after the first 5 minutes of shouting the teacher pretty much gave
    up teaching for the day

     My school would not calm

     I live in germany, and I don't think that this would be a huge deal here. Maybe in younger classes, but in
    sex-education we learn that things like porn an masturbating are pretty normal and everyone does it.

     Jokes on you it would take me 3 seconds

     you couldn't calm my school down.

     Yea lol my school is 4000+ kids

     Yeah same for me(at my old school), especially for prep rallies the 6th grade will be talking about this
    shit for a year.

     One time when I was in highschool the principal held an assembly to ban “the penis game.” However the only
    way to have this game banned, was to inevitably say the penis game. Let’s just say having your principal
    say “Penis” in a deep booming voice over microphone to a room of like 500 kids probably wasn’t the right
    move.   Every time we saw him later we would just say he won the game for saying it the loudest

     We're all immature here

     My school would not calm down in years

     My entire school would be white

     They’d have to cancel the assembly for my school, no way people are chilling out after that

     A teacher got a vid leaked of her giving a blowjob to another teacher (the guy getting the bj was
    married), vid got leaked in like November/December. March 13th 2:15 (last day of school before school
    closed due to covid. 5 minutes before the final bell) me and my friends were still laughing abt it. There
    was this giant pole on a desk and one of my friends said “Yo u/jaybankzz do the ms *teachers name*” (I
    won’t say her or my name) it was hilarious

     My teachers would just let everyone go home because they know nobody would shut up about it for the rest
    of the day

     My school would’ve gone absolutely mad and I just know that we would’ve all ended up going home after
    someone pulled the fire alarm or started pushing people down the stairs. Still, at least if wasn’t a
    totally boring assembly- must’ve  been funny watching everyone go insane

     We would talk about it our entire lives ""dude do you remember 'that' day?"" "" yeah bro, pretty epic.
    actually i jerked off after the class"" "" me too"" ""who invited you here, tom?""



 *After assembly*   Dave, could you tell me why that was there? 
 
     I was horny James, fuck off!

     That's why the presentation literally had a ""Fuck you"" in it.

     Yeah, we were just all bundled up together but were wearing masks  The goddamn science teacher coughed (no
    mask, not even a hand over his mouth) while we were walking past :/

     Yeah, schools are terrible for social distancing.   At my school we (for some reason) still have PE.
    During PE yesterday we played a game called “dikke Berta”(translate from dutch to: “fat Berta”)  the goal
    of the game is to get to the other side...without being picked up.  So there is one “Berta”. Everybody
    starts running to the other side and when “Berta” picks somebody up they become a “Berta” as well.
    Eventually you get 5/6/7/ect people trying to pick you up.  Terrible idea during a pandemic. Nobody is
    wearing masks and everybody is touching each other.

     Lol yeah the logic in the education system is just *chefs kiss*

     we do paperwork about being a... \*checks notes\* digital class.

     I just finished watching the movie today!



 my school did a unit on porn...  when we were in sixth grade... 
 
     Was the class about how bad it is or a showcase?

     When I was in 7th grade they did that   It was basically ‘porn is bad’ but not because of the whole sex
    thing but because of the objectification of people on it and they actually taught us something decent for
    once

     For me it was in 4th...

     And I thought the teacher showing us a live child birth in 7th grade was bad...  Edit: it was a video, he
    wasn’t giving birth in the classroom lol

     [removed]

     Omg that must’ve been bad

     We didn't get one :(



 My digital art teacher constantly watched porn in class, and accidentally
projected it to the class. He didn't show up the next year   I always did wonder
why he constantly put in credit card information, but art supplies never showed
up for class .-.

I'm aborting my baby and I feel like shit,"I'm aborting my baby and I feel like shit

I'm 19, 16 weeks pregnant. I just found out yesterday when I went to get an
ultrasound. At first, I couldn't process it. I saw my baby move on the screen.
Just saying that feels weird. Then, when the doctor called my boyfriend inside,
I just lost it. I cried so hard. I didn't want to be pregnant, was the only
thing I thought at that moment. After payment, my boyfriend calmed me down. I
couldn't control my tears. I thought of every possibility, what would happen if
I decided to keep it, and what would happen if I decided to abort it. After many
tears and a long discussion, I have decided to abort it. I've been feeling this
motherly love, but I know that I am not ready to be a mother. And if I decided
to keep my baby, I will have to give it up to a shelter. I can't afford to raise
it. I know that if I were to keep it, I would want to raise it as a proper,
ready mother. I'm just not all that, yet. My boyfriend is taking responsibility
and finding ways to earn money to pay for my abortion. I'm glad he's doing his
part. I just cannot help but feel so guilty. Every time I eat, I know I am
feeding my baby as well. But then, I'm aborting it soon. I feel my baby bump, I
close my eyes and see my moving baby on the ultrasound screen. I just feel so so
guilty, it already has a heart, I remember hearing the audio of it's heart
beating. I feel so useless. In my religion, abortion is a sin. I'm not sure what
to think right now. I just know I feel like a sh*thead for wanting to abort my
16 week, healthy baby.

      I’m sorry you’re going through this. I can’t even imagine how difficult

     thank you so much ❤️❤️

     ` ` ` Hi. ` ` `



 I'm so sorry you have to go through this especially st such a young age. I wish
you the best for everything. 
 


 Damn, that's a tough situation. I can't imagine how hard it must be for you
right now. Just know that whatever decision you make, it's your choice and no
one else's. Don't let anyone guilt trip you about it. Take care of yourself
first and foremost. 
 


 If your boyfriend has to scramble together enough money for an abortion then you
are doing the right thing.   You can’t afford to give a child the life it
deserves right now. You are doing the best thing you can in your situation 
 


 I have no comforting words or anything, but. Just keep stronger and good luck.
Please stop upvoting me for showing basic courtesy. 
 
     Thank you ❤️



 It must feel horrible, but youre not doing anything selfish. Raising a child
when youre not ready to, thats the selfish choice. Keep being strong <3

"Hello, r/Teenagers. Teacher here. I wanted to give you an honest accounting of which annoying parts of remote learning (turning on mics, cameras, dress code, etc.) are real and which ones are bullshit.","Hello, r/Teenagers. Teacher here. I wanted to give you an honest accounting of which annoying parts of remote learning (turning on mics, cameras, dress code, etc.) are real and which ones are bullshit.

I've seen a lot of memes and posts complaining about the different things
teachers make you do during online classes. I thought it might be helpful to
tell you which ones you're completely right about (shh, don't tell them I told
you) and which ones are actually important.  1. \*\*Dress codes, inappropriate
attire, etc.\*\*This one is total bullshit. It doesn't matter what you wear, as
long as you're wearing something. Seriously, who cares? Schools or teachers that
enforce dress codes during remote learning are making a bad situation worse. You
should be comfortable.  &#x200B;  2) \*\*Location. eg. laying in bed during
class\*\*I don't know why anyone cares about this one either. Whether you're in
bed, on your couch, at the kitchen table...who cares? It's annoying that some
schools have rules about this sort of thing. Again, you should be comfortable.
&#x200B;  3) \*\*Please turn on your cameras\*\*Ok, here's where I stop
pretending to be cool and make enemies. It's super important that you turn on
your camera, even if it makes you more comfortable not to. You have no idea how
much teachers feed off of and respond to body language. This is the main way a
decent teacher can tell if you're interested, if you're confused, or even if
you're bored or tired. Teaching to empty black windows feels terrible; it's like
standing in front of a classroom of empty desks. There's no feedback at all, so
we just flail around. Imagine doing stand-up comedy to an empty theater and
you'll understand how humiliating it feels. All that I ask for is having your
full head visible, so I can see your facial expression, and so that you can nod
'yes' or 'no'.  &#x200B;  4) \*\*Eyes forward\*\*This one is stupid. You don't
have to be staring into the camera to be able to hear and understand. You're not
always looking right at the teacher during a real class, so unless you're
clearly doing something you shouldn't be, I don't really care where you're
looking.  &#x200B;  5) \*\*Please turn on your mics\*\*This is the front-line in
the war between teachers and students during remote learning. I understand how
tempting and powerful the notion of being able to mute yourself is--a power you
never had in the Before Times. However, here's what it looks like from a
teacher's perspective: I ask a question to a screen full of people leaning back
in their chairs/beds with their mics off. I absolutely \*know\* that nobody is
going to answer it. Getting up the nerve to answer a question in class or
participate in a discussion is hard enough, having to sit up, lean forward, and
click a button makes it almost impossible.  A muted mic also means that nobody
will \*ask\* any questions either. Asking questions is incredibly important for
learning, as the smart kids are well aware. It's also important for the
teachers. We screw up all the time and we rely on students to ask questions
about things we forgot to mention. We even need you to correct us when we're
wrong (Personally, I can't write on a board and talk at the same time, so I
often end up filling the board with really weird errors).  A caveat to this is
that, if you have a noisy house or a malfunctioning microphone, it's definitely
better to keep it muted. You should also be free to mute when you're doing work
or when it's not an active discussion or lesson.  6) \*\*Changing your
background\*\*This one is fine. I don't think it's as hilarious as you do,
though. So I just ignore it.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  7) \*\*Petting your
dog/cat\*\*Ugh, fine, I guess. As long as you're still able to write/type.
&#x200B;  &#x200B;  8)\*\*Food, drink, props, etc.\*\*Again, who cares if
students eat? In fact, since there's no risk of you making a mess in the
classroom, it should be even more acceptable during remote learning. It's
ridiculous that a kid got expelled for playing with a toy gun during online
school. You're stuck at home without normal classroom interaction; anything that
makes it easier for you without disrupting others is fine by me.  &#x200B;
9)\*\*Parents\*\*This one is a dealbreaker. Your parents should absolutely stay
the f\*ck out of it. They shouldn't be sitting next to you during class, or
walking in to check on things, or--holy shit--asking or answering questions. Can
you imagine how insane it would be if your parent walked into the classroom and
acted that way?? (In case you didn't already know, teachers generally hate
parents. A dumb or annoying student is nothing compared to a dumb or annoying
parent).  Final thoughts:I will be the first to admit it: remote learning is
completely terrible. It's terrible for you; it's terrible for us. We're not able
to teach effectively, and you're not able to learn effectively. You're isolated
from social interaction and presented with tons of easily-available
distractions. Nobody wins in this scenario.  I hope this post was somewhat
enlightening. Feel free to call me out on anything you don't agree with. If
there's something annoying I forgot to put on the list, ask, and I'll do my best
to tell you the truth about it.   \---------------------------  EDIT: Thanks for
all of the awards and interest. I'm glad so many people found this helpful. For
what it's worth, I also found it extremely helpful. I really enjoyed hearing
your stories about your experiences, especially those about school systems or
teachers with insane requirements. It should also go without saying that my
experiences are not the same as everyone's experiences, and that we have a
hugely diverse range of schools, classes, and students in the comments.  A lot
of people have commented or messaged me asking questions, which I'll try to
answer here briefly.     \-I teach high school juniors and seniors. My classes
are not typical HS classes, but I teach way more total students per semester
than a normal teacher, but for less time. My class includes grammar, math,
writing, science, and other stuff. I understand that things are different for
elementary-aged students in remote learning--honestly, online elementary-school
is a terrifying hellscape that makes teaching teenagers seem like a dream
vacation.     \-If there's loud background noise or feedback, I definitely ask
students to mute their mics. In my experience, this is pretty rare, but I guess
it's very common for others.      \-Based on discussion in the comments, we may
have discovered that there's a particular type of anxiety that comes with being
on camera, especially when one's own camera feed is visible, that doesn't
compare with being looked at in real life. We should probably tell psychologists
about this if we can't go back to in-person school.     \-I may have been
hyperbolic when I said that teachers hate parents. But parents can be
unbelievably annoying. Like really, really annoying. Actually, for a lot of
teachers, what I said is true.     \-For those of you asking if I can be your
teacher--actually, I could be, sort of, since I'm doing online tutoring these
days. However, there are so many trolls among you that I'd have to be an idiot
to give you contact info  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

 My teachers always make us mute our mics unless we have a question. 
 
     [deleted]

     I'm old and on this sub because I work with teens. Anywho, my 5 year old son had his first day of virtual
    kindergarten and the teacher attempted it with mikes on. It was a fucking disaster. A hilarious disaster.
    That pretty much sums up virtual kindergarten so far.

     Yep same

     Yup, can relate

     Same lol

     yeah, same exact way with all my teachers.

     Another teacher here.  I use google meets and if the mics aren’t muted there is a LOT of feedback.

     Same

     Same. Many of my classmates have younger siblings or loud pets so whenever they unmute you can hear them.

     same lol, I use a profile picture and I always have my mic muted. If you enable a pfp not a lot of
    teachers will care, I had mine enabled as Meat Worm from some old MSN commercial and nobody noticed lol

     same

     Same here. I think it's correct cause of the fucking horrible x box toddler screeching mic static that
    most students have

     Same. It’s an all boys school and never short of delinquents.  Once had a classmate swear in his mic
    during online class. Funs stuff.

     same

     We do online lessons over discord and if we want to ask a question we put a question mark in chat and he
    unmutes us



 [deleted] 
 
     Where I study or at least used to study, we don’t ask any questions in a lot of subjects since we more or
    less get whatever’s happening.   Now it’s a lot more amplified since not only are we silent, we’re also
    invisible so basically nonexistent.

     I also find it very distracting to have any background noise like crinkling bags or whatever. (I have
    minor misophonia)

     Also, there’s the issue of random background noise. I don’t think my class would appreciate it if my
    brother decided to play his saxophone while I was on a class Zoom.

     Plus zoom software can come in and override the teacher talking, to say, the wind is blowing at someone’s
    house for example.

     Most of my teachers make sure 100% that the mics are muted so I agree to disagreeing.

     all my teachers let us mute our mics unless they specifically ask us to unmute them, if the teacher is
    just talking and teaching things and theres no questions or anything we just keep our mics muted. the
    teacher usually asks if we have any questions and if any student has any they can just unmute and ask and
    re-mute.

     Yup one of my teachers tried to have all our mics on and there was so much background noise. Chip
    bags,feedback,screaming babies, dogs, etc. it was hard to hear the teacher without getting distracted.

     And let's not forget the ones that make random noise into the microphones while unmuted just to troll.
    Thank god I don't have online class anymore.

     there's these one or two kids in my class that feel the need to stick their mic down their throat every
    time they talk

     Between shitty mics and lack of noise cancelling software on zoom or the average person’s computer, there
    would be a metric fuck ton of background noise to the point where it would be hard to hear the teacher
    during remote learning.

     true one of my friends(ish)'s mic likes to crap out on him a lot which ends up with everyone except me
    dying from earrape. im used to earrape cause i got siblings



 I wish this chad was my teacher 
 
     Ifkr

     same hereeeeeee like serious goals right here

     What if they are?

     He sounds like the BEST teacher in the world, litterally. Down to earth, a Redditor, nice sense of humour,
    chill.. 10/10

     This man's a fucking legend.

     U antisocial weirdo



 Finally, a reasonable teacher. Thanks for not being an asshole, you guys need to
get paid WAY more :) 
 
     One of my teachers doesn’t let us unmute and we have to request permission to unmute just to ask a
    question.

     Teachers get paid enough, come on now dawg. They even get paid during summer break, when they're barely
    working! And it obviously depends on where you're from, but the average teacher in my district probably
    makes around 75k annually.



 I agree with most of your points but I definitely think that, even if you don’t
have a noisy house, you should still be muted when you aren’t talking.
Microphones pick up all sorts of details and feedback and, while normally this
wouldn’t be a problem because the noise just wouldn’t be so apparent, in a
virtual classroom all of those noises are right in your ear.  I also disagree on
your final thoughts. I think it really depends on what type of class it is.
Discussion based classes obviously are a lot harder virtually but lecture based
so much better since the teacher can do things like record their lectures
instead of doing it live. This means students can watch/listen to the lectures
when they can focus instead of during the day when there could be several other
people in the house making lots of noise and making it hard to concentrate. Of
course this also depends on the grade because elementary students are far less
able to reach out to teachers if they have questions but high school and college
students should be capable of asking the teachers questions so that other
students can work at their own pace rather than forcing the teacher to repeat
themselves in an in person/live class. 
 
     You're definitely right when it comes to age groups. It is exponentially more difficult the lower the age
    range. I'm lucky that my students are highschool juniors and seniors. The type of go-at-your-own-pace
    video lecture classes are good--that's why we've been doing it that way for online classes in college.
    However, remote learning is absolutely worse for anything that's trying to replace an in-person class.

     I once had a mic that would pick up dust hitting it so I had to stay muted or on push to talk all the time
    so there are reasons to be muted

     I’d personally say something like a physical mute button instead of a mute on the call would be better,
    though i know that’s not an option to EVERYONE, it is an option to a lot of people who have any sort of
    headset over $20.

     This makes sense but for me (I'm a college student- did 2 years on a campus and finishing online due to
    Covid and moving around) online lectures that are pre recorded are so much harder for me to follow. I get
    distracted and I like the interaction of getting to ask questions during it. Plus, if I don't understand
    something during a lecture at the beginning that's fundamental for me to understand another part I either
    have to rewatch it later after sending an email and waiting for a response (currently 2 of my online
    professors don't respond to any emails) which puts me out of learning mode or I have to pause it and wait
    for an answer which also puts me out of learning mode

 Personally, I love online learning. At least where I'm at, we didn't have to do
video calls for class (past tense because some idiots decided to reopen).
Everyone got to sleep in. My teachers just uploaded the homework along with an
instruction video on microsoft teams. If anyone was confused, they could start a
post and ask a question.   Before covid, learning was drastically slowed down so
everyone could understand it. I catch on quite quickly, so I'm bored during the
majority of class. Being able to sleep in, rush in all of my classes before
noon, and still get an A was a dream come true. 
 
     Dang I wish my online learning was like that

     same! i got better grades than ever and i worked less than ever and i had a valid excuse to stay in my
    room as long as i wanted

     The sleeping in thing is huge for me, I have to travel for 2 hours (I know, could be worse but it's not
    great either) which means I have to wake up at 6:00am and it means I'm regularly sleep deprived a bit (I
    can't sleep early enough, believe me I've tried) which really really doesn't help with learning.

     Yeah I had a system basically just like that and it worked great for me and a lot of my friends. Honestly
    when things are normal if I could do online school all the time and use the time I save to hang out with
    friends to replace the social aspect of school it would be perfect. However it does seem like online
    classes (especially for like science and math) lead to those who are more competent steamrolling ahead and
    those who are struggling falling further behind, so I'm not sure it would be a great system for everyone.

     Honestly tho

     We use teams to It is not that bad at least better than a stream you can do nothing with

     That's how learning was for me during last school year. I like it but I don't think I learned as much as I
    do now, with classes being live. I really don't mind it either way I just wanna go back to real school.

     Last year my teachers did this but now they have a schedule and it’s basically all the downsides of school
    plus all the downsides of online learning put together, I loved online learning way more when I got to fly
    by each assignment but now it’s block scheduling with hour and a half long classes that go over it but
    since we have zoom calls for so long I have no time in the zoom days to do work because of football so I
    have to get the instructions, wait either 2-4 days before I can work on it and then spend half of the time
    remembering what I need to do



 I really hate online learning for a multitude of reasons, but on of the worst
things are the technical problems. I will always have my camera on unless there
is a problem but the moment it goes off no matter what happened teachers start
getting pissed the moment it turns off 
 


 Is there an exception to the camera rule for anxiety disorders? A close friend
of mine has one pretty bad, and gets really (and I mean really) anxious with
their camera on. 
 
     What did they do during normal school?

     Looks like me and your friend think the same. I used to have horrible social anxiety until less than a
    year ago, where I somehow managed to convince myself nobody cares and nobody's watching. With cameras, it
    comes back full force. I'll have a panic attack and feel sick with worry if I even try to turn it on. I
    physically harm myself as an outlet when that happens.  Edit: ""physically harm myself"" as in ""smacking my
    arms and pulling on my hair a bit"". I don't cut. And I don't intentionally hurt myself any other time.

     This is tricky. It's a strange issue. I certainly don't like having a camera on in front of me. It's
    honestly weird, but probably good, that we haven't gotten used to omnipresent cameras in our lives.   The
    obvious point that teachers would make is: you aren't invisible in school. That may seem like a simple
    comeback, but it's true. The comments below seem to suggest something similar.      Personally, when I
    have a student who tells me that they aren't comfortable with their camera on, I don't force them.
    However, not going to lie, I basically forget that they exist unless they verbally chime in. I have no
    feedback to assess their understanding, so they will receive worse instruction--as simple as that.

     Cant they just not have it on?If a teacher requires it get the parents to email them about it.

     As someone with mild social anxiety, *this.* Cameras feel so much worse, because I always feel like there
    are people staring at me, and I can see everybody's faces while I talk.

     it doesn't matter really much since  everyone else only looks at themselves anyway

     [deleted]



 Hey, so, my school has a policy where its mandatory for you to keep your cameras
turned on when theres an exam, but when there aren't any exams, you can keep
your cameras turned off. The principal said that as students, we need to do what
our teachers say but when a teacher asked for you to open your cameras and you
weren't taking a test, you dont need to open your camera.   Now, my English
teacher(on every single class) is asking us to keep our cams on. What bothers me
is: She says if we dont open it we will lose participation points. I said to her
that it is within my rights to keep my camera off if I wanted to, and she said I
was lying.  Should I talk to her in private or say something to the principal?
This has been going on for 2 months now. 
 
     In my post, I outlined why it's important to have cams on and why teachers prefer it. However, it's
    definitely not ok to tie cameras to points. As we've seen in the comments, not everybody has a working
    camera.      If you want to contact the principle or teacher, use the phrase ""taking away points for not
    having a camera on outside of a test is not an equitable practice"". There's almost certainly something in
    the remote learning guidelines about things being 'equitable'.

     I think you should talk to her in private first, and if she still says that you're lying, then talk to the
    principal. If your school created that policy and a teacher is violating it, I think you should definitely
    tell someone. Especially the fact that she's grading you for it. If someone did that in my school, things
    wouldn't end well for them.

Screen time passcode,"Screen time passcode

My parents have screen time limits and stuff on my phone.  Anyone know how I
could change settings without the code or how I could find out the code?

 Ok this trick works well if your parents hands normally get greasy.  First wipe
your screen clean like really really clean. Then find a reason to let your
parents put the password on your phone rather than you sending a request for
more time.( make sure you don’t touch the screen in this time period) When you
get your phone back try to see where the grease/oil is left on and mark it using
whatever you like. Input your password using the help of those marks.  Worked
for me and did it a couple times 
 
     Probably will be doing this.  Thank you a bunch

     I wish my parents were that stupid



 I managed to get mine by trying a random password in the password book and got
it first try 
 


 Birth year 
 


 i got a trick that works, if you go to setting and click reset all and it will
give u infinite attempts of guessing ur screentime passcode 
 
     where in settings do you go to reset all?



 my mum always keeps hers in the notes app bcs she changes it a lot and can nvr
remember so find an excuse to use ur parents phone eg. playing music in the car
and then go into their notes app and check if its there  my parents might be
different tho gng 
 


 Screen record them typing it in 
 
     Screen record on iphones will detect if a password is being entered and will hide the interface

     that doesnt work

 The passcode is either someones birth year or birthday. Always is. 
 
     it shows failed passcode attempts tho so idk if i could even guess it



 I actually made a post about this, found a really nice method around it. If you
have location services not restricted, you can edit the time and date of the
phone.   When your reach you’re time limit on an app, go to the calender and
pick some distant date in the future, like one month from now, then go into the
app and Click “One More Minute”, and then turn you’re date and time back to
normal.   It should just work until the distant date actually rolls around. I
use this method literally like last week so, lmk if it works. 
 
     yess thank you i know how to get past these its js recovering the damn app store ugh

Screentime Bypassing (Full Tutorial),"Screentime Bypassing (Full Tutorial)

So over the past 3 years I have learned a lot about the screen time for iOS
devices and in this post I will be talking about all the information I've
learned including: screentime bypasses, old screentime bypasses,and how to
delete screentime data.  \*\*Former Screentime Bypasses\*\*  So the screentime
bypasses mentioned in this section are ways that use to work to bypass
screentime but no longer do.  1. Having the Code   Until iOS 18.5 released if
you were somehow able to get the code you could have unlimited screentime. Well
unfortunately now every time you enter the screentime passcode it sends a
notification to the parents/guardians phone.  2. FaceTime Glitch   Another trick
that use to work was the FaceTime glitch. This was a glitch where you could call
a friend and let them control your phone on a call and then it would glitch and
give you unlimited time. Unfortunately this way was patched in the latest
update.  \*\*Screentime Bypasses\*\*  The information in this section talks
about all the current ways to bypass screentime. Unfortunately the list grows
smaller and smaller over the years and we're running out of ways to bypass it.
1. Disabling Wi-Fi   For this method of bypassing you will need to know the
screentime passcode. What you want to do is go to your requested website/app
then turn off your cellular data and Wi-Fi then enter the code and reconnect to
the Wi-Fi. This will make it where it doesn't send the guardian/parent a
notification.   Note: If you need the screentime passcode you can go to ""Erase
Data"" in settings and enter your Apple ID password then you will have unlimited
attempts to guess the password. You can also try cleaning off your screen with
cleaning spray and looking for your parents faint fingerprints when they enter
the code.  2. Change the Date and Time   This method will only work if your
parents have not disabled changing Date and Time. But this one is self
explanatory. Just go into settings and change the Date and Time to a time of the
day where your apps are unblocked.  3. Webloc Shortcut (Websites only)   This
method is probably the most overpowered method of all of these as you do not
need to know the code or anything and it doesn't add to screentime. All you need
is to have the shortcuts app downloaded and to not have any limits on the Files
app. What you want to do is click on the link below then follow the prompts and
enter the URL of the desired website. Then go to the files app and click on the
file.   Link:shortcutsgallery.c/shortcuts/webloc-manager/   4. Google
Chrome/Fire Cast TV   Over my years of searching for a way to hide my screentime
I came across these 2 apps. Essentially what they do is let you go to any
website without adding to screentime. Honestly the 3 of these have helped me a
lot out through my teenage years.  Logging Out of Apple Account (Not
Recommended) If you do this one this should be your very last option as this
will quit showing screentime on your parents devices completely. You will most
likely get caught quickly if you do this so I highly recommend not doing it.
\*\*Deleting Screentime\*\*   Over my time of finding bypasses I have found a
way to completely hide Screentime activity for apps. All you need to do is
delete an app once and redownload it. This will then have your Screentime greyed
out and your parents will not be able to see what apps you were using.   Note:
If you don't have Screentime on the App Store you can type in the name of the
app in the search bar that appears when swiping down on the home screen.
\*\*Conclusion\*\*   So these are the many ways I have personally overcome
screentime in my life. I know it's hard having screentime on and not being able
to do the things you enjoy so I hope I was able to help everyone out and I will
be answering questions in the replies. Good luck 👍

 Thank you bro, right now I have an hour a day on Tiktoc and I’m just trying to
bypass that 
 
     I have a minute 😭

     Bet

     i have 3 hours total its actually terrible

     did you figure out a method?



 i gotta find a way to bypass my screen time limit, it turns off at 11:00 pm at
night and turns on again at 7:00 am 
 
     use it at midnight



 i have one for steaming   if you go on a website (only some work for eg.
[ww7.123movies.com](http://ww7.123movies.com) works ; to check if it works if it
brigs you to the safari app, then that website doesn't sadly) and add to
homescreen you can use it even if you have screen time on safari.  click one
more minute and kill the bookmark (idk if its just my phone but i only kill it
because it doesn't let me click anything)  then watch something real quick so
you can go on the apple media player thingy  then you can check if it is working
by dragging down on whatever ur watching so you can faintly see if the sand
timer is there(if u have a timer on the website)  idk why but you have to do it
for a streak but the 2nd and sometimes the 3rd day doesn't work aswell  it still
shows that u spend time on the website sorry😒 but parents cant do anything about
it  this was developed by yours truly over the months   i guess strict parents
really do raise sneaky children lol. 
 


 there was this glitch i would do idk if it is recommended but what i would do
was power off my phone like reset it and sometimes it would glitch my apps on a
certain try but it would either not have sound or it would but i think its been
patched because it hasnt been working. 
 
     I wish more glitches like this existed



 if you use the Google Chrome trick DO NOT download iOS 26. It will allow Apple
to trac websites within Chrome 🫩 
 
     I made a mistake...

     Yeah same with edge and FF 😔 and I have no iOS 18 backup because it replaced it. Shiny glass is not worth
    it

     The same thing happened to me so I’m trying to find way to bypass it

     NOOOOO



 if i knew the screentime passcode i wouldnt be here?? 😭😭 
 
     Right



 Thanks 
 
     No problem! I enjoy helping people out with screentime issues.



 Wait where do I find erase data? 
 
     a new way is go to transfer/reset iphone in general in settings, itll ask for ur phone password, u write
    it. then it'll ask for a screen time password. there u have UNLIMITED guesses. start at 0001, 0002 then
    between 0000 and 9999, there is 9999 possibilities and one of them HAS to be the password. then js go back
    so u dont erase ur iphone. worked for me now ik the pw. I js did it yesterday

     Unfortunately I have recently recieved news that this method no longer works. 



 If I use the turning WiFi and data off option can I use it to put apps into the
always allowed section without sending a notification to my parents? 
 
     I'm pretty sure it wouldnt send a notification



 The link is not working for me, just says safari can’t open the page because the
server can’t be found 
 
     I'll try to find the og link then

 The passcode is either someones birth year or birthday. Always is. 
 
     it shows failed passcode attempts tho so idk if i could even guess it



 I actually made a post about this, found a really nice method around it. If you
have location services not restricted, you can edit the time and date of the
phone.   When your reach you’re time limit on an app, go to the calender and
pick some distant date in the future, like one month from now, then go into the
app and Click “One More Minute”, and then turn you’re date and time back to
normal.   It should just work until the distant date actually rolls around. I
use this method literally like last week so, lmk if it works. 
 
     yess thank you i know how to get past these its js recovering the damn app store ugh

"You always see those girls, and sometimes guys too","You always see those girls, and sometimes guys too



 A girl In my dschool was making fun of a guy because he had a galaxy s20
meanwhile she has an iPhone 6 
 
     Ok that just shows how dumb some people can be

     The funniest was when a girl was making fun of my Pixel 3a XL, but she had an iPhone 4, I was laughing so
    hard.

     Yeah let me just call the guy with a $1000+ phone poor while using some $150 phone that is almost 6 years
    old

     Its dumb to make fun of peoples phone choice but also remember that your doing the same!   I could have
    gotten any phone i wanted but u got an iphone 7 because i like how it felt and dont want to get a new one
    any time soon

     6s+ is my current phone and I don’t want to upgrade, if I would it would be a 7 or 8. Just not Android
    because I don’t like those phones, I’ve had a few and never liked them.

     6 and 7 were peak iPhone years imo

     Same, I have an S20+ which is over $1300 (with tax) and thus more expensive than most brand new iPhones

     Iphone 6 is good tho

     S20? I've only heard of the S10

     [removed]

      iphone 6s supremacy

     Then she gets offended when you tell her



 I use both  Iphones r nice and all, but Androids can last 12 solid years on 3
percent 
 
     Iphone batteries infuriate me after using a phone with a battery that easily lasts me 3 days

     My biggest thing with android is that they only get like 2 updates

     Hehe idc about iphone or android  The phone in the market which gives smoothest gameplay is the phone I
    want Nowadays my eyes is on asus ROG 3 it's dynamic trigger is OP as hell and give support to my 4 finger

     I use an iPhone and I hate everything but the ui. Absolutely frustrating that my battery lasts me less
    than a day and I can’t play emulators and rom hacks :/



 Ikr like bitch mind your own fucking business we all die in the end anyways 
 
     Damn bro

     Ma homieeee

     [deleted]

     I think my old phone was about that old, but only one dent on the corner. Also it was a Samsung

     Jesus, you good man?



 I remember someone PMing me on a Zoom meeting calling me Broke for having a Note
20 5G  Last I saw her, she had a destroyed iPhone 7 
 
     Insulting Androids is the only way she can chill her damned ego.

     damn. how shallow is she

     Sometimes i wonder if people actually use their brain to talk.

     Lmao she deserved it cuz your phone has a Snapdragon 865 processor which is really fast and iPhone 7 is
    just dust compared to your phone



 Well apple isnt performance/money, its money/performance 
 
     the new m1 macs kinda change that

     But you can keep one for 6-7 years easily so to me it justifies the price

     Im so sick of seeing this myth. They are leading in performance and are very strong Camera competitors.
    Yes they got less Ram, it doesn’t matter tho. Yes just 60hz, can’t defend that, I can’t defend the pro
    devices either, but the 12 is a great Allrounder phone, and that’s what Apple aiming for.

     Could you explain?



 phone is phone

     iPhones are fun androids are people who doesn't really care about having alot of friends or someone who
    has a nice job at a desk. My cousin and 2 of my uncles have galaxy notes and just happen to be IT
    technicians.



 I want to know how people break their phone so badly. Like are you trying to
break it? I’ve had this phone for 3 years and there isn’t a single crack
anywhere. 
 
     Yeah it’s a mystery to me, everyone says the screens are so fragile but I’ve put mine through hell and the
    worst so far was a few hairline cracks on the screen protector

     I've never cracked a phone screen.  Then again, I've only owned android phones.

     *laughs in android with otter box*



 How did you perfectly describe my sister? 
 


 [removed] 
 
     My dad had a pixel 2, and he dropped it without a case many times, and nothing broke. Then, it was sadly
    chopped in half by a lawnmower. Rip pixel 2

     Ok but like seriously iPhones are indestructible as long as I own them. I have owned 3 and dropped them
    countless times yet they haven’t even spawned a crack on the screen.   I literally threw one at the floor
    with all my strength just to prove this to my friend and lo and behold no cracks.



 It triggers me you buy a phone but cant afford a case for 3€. I have my phone
now for 4 years dropped it several times and it never got a scratch. 
 
     Fr. So many iPhone users have no case on their phone and then wonder why it shattered after 3 drops. I’ve
    had mine go down a flight of concrete stairs and it didn’t have a scratch on it

Bypassing screen time,"Bypassing screen time

Ik this might be a little off topic but i figured someone here might know. my
parents prohibit social media and talking to strangers, so they put this app
called bark on my phone to monitor it. Eventually they moved on to apple screen
time. I knew the passcode so i downloaded all these apps and it was fine. Fast
forward to ts friday and they found out. They deleted them all, set their app
limit to 0 hours 0 minutes, and changed the password. I wanna use discord again
to talk to my friends and stuff and i hate using the web page. Is there anyway
to get around this limit? for additional info - Ios 18.4, Iphone 15, Dont know
the passcode, parents are decently good with tech.  Extra extra info - They dont
really know what discord is they just saw it and decided to restrict it. If i
ask to get it back they will obviously say no and make sure i dont get it but if
i just turn the limit off they probably wouldnt mind yknow.

 threaten to put them in the cheapest nursing home you can find

 They say no to discord But allow reddit Righttt

How to get around Screen Time,"How to get around Screen Time

&#x200B;  Here are some ways to get around screen time that nobody talks about
and all you need is the password to your parent's phone.  If you have the device
of a parent that has you on screen time, you can change the screen time password
easily by just knowing their device password. So just by knowing their iphone
password you can change the screen time passcode. The best part is **you do not
have to know the screen time password in order to change it.** But the hard part
is getting ahold of their phone while they are not looking. Just get ahold of a
device that has them signed into it with their apple ID, such as their phone or
IPAD. Once you have their phone or other device:   1. Go to settings 2. Click on
screen time then your account 3. Scroll near the bottom.  4. Ask to change the
password. Face ID will pop up but after a while of it not recognizing your face,
it will ask you to type in the device password. Once you do that, you can then
change the screen time passcode.  Another great thing about this is that you are
changing the password for you only. If you have siblings their screen time
passwords will not be affected at all. Just make sure to click on your account
when you are trying to change it and go from there.  Your parent will get
suspicious if your apps all of a sudden have no limits or downtime. So I suggest
you keep quiet. Don't change any settings so all looks well. Now you know the
password so you can give yourself unlimited time as you'd like.  There is one
downside. Screen time still **shows time on apps** whether you like that or not.
But there are ways to get around this. Lets say you spent 7 hours on your phone
today. Screen time will show that you spent 7 hours and if you scroll to the
bottom, it will show what apps you used and how much time you spent. But if you
**delete an app**, then when you scroll to the bottom, that app will not be
there. Your parents will be confused why it says you spent 7 hours on your phone
but when they scroll to the bottom, the app will have been erased. You can tell
them it's a glitch and get away with it.  But if you'd preferably want to erase
all screen time data, just sign out of your apple id and sign back in. There is
a downside though, all past screen time dates and information may be erased.
Also, if your parent has some other controllability on your device that you may
not be aware of, you might not be able to sign out of your apple ID.  What if
you don't want to go through the trouble of changing the screen time password
and instead just want more time on your apps?  You can **add more time on your
apps,** within only a couple of seconds of touching your parent's phone. When
you send a screen time request, it pops up as a notification first. Just open
their phone, scroll down to look at their notifications on the front phone
screen. Press down on the screen time request and it will allow you to give
yourself more time and all you needed to do was log into their phone.  One last
thing I want to bring up. This is for the crazy people out there but desperate
times calls for desperate measures. If you want complete control over screen
time, you can do this by reseting your parent's apple ID password. All you need
is your parent's iphone password. Simply go into settings and change the apple
ID passcode or even just sign out of their account. I call this crazy because it
will sign them out of all of their devices that have apple ID in them. It may
reset a ton of things on their device. And a bunch of other things depending. I
don't recommend it.  But there you go. I just thought I'd give some tips and
tricks since nobody really talks about the other possibilities besides finding
sneaky ways to watch your parents type in the password. Goodbye.

 I think, for my screentime limits, my dad randomly pulled a chad move and
removed them- love you papa 
 


 When I press change screen time password it doesn’t do the whole Face ID scan
thing, it just comes up with enter screen time password. It’s an iPad Pro so I
can’t really do anything else. 
 
     Same

     Same here



 i fucking love u bro 
 


 TYSM UR A LIFE SAVER 
 


 what do u do if it says enter the screentime pw? 
 
     Try using a different device they might be signed into ( ipad or something) and see if you can change it
    from there. Good luck



 When u change the password will it send them an email about it or a
notification. Im considering changing it using my dads iphone 11 that he uses to
play music, not his main phone which is a 15 
 
     nope, unless you decide to change their apple ID password (which would sign them out anything that uses
    it) But I made this post over a year ago so I don't know if it has changed or not since then.

     I’m hoping it’s not too late by the time I’m sending this but in the newest iPhone update they made it
    where it sends a notification to the parent’s phone every time you enter the code on your device. So even
    if you do get the code dont enter it or you’re cooked (like me).



 Also if ur tired of the screen time crap if u go into ur settings then general
then scroll down and then u will see time and date and u can change the time 
 
      it says i cant manually change it due to screen time settings. fuck



 I have an official way to get past screentime on android no joke. Btw I'm doing
it rn. So basically go to settings and find assistance menu and turn it on a
square looking thing should appear on your screen. That means it works then
download a app called yandex so many different types but all of them work. Btw
you can download apps from the galaxy store without permission so that's were u
should get it from. Then when downtime comes along press the square looking
thing and press home when your on the home screen press yandex it's not greyed
out so it should work and yandex is basically Russian google but if u want
google just type it in. I want to thank the 8 year old for the way to get to the
home screen and the random reddit user for yandex thx for reading and happy
bypassing

at least turn off the screen time restriction completely as soon as i turned 18

paid and as a broke teenager I cannot pay for it. I also have a pc which doesn't
have screen time on it or anything so I can download absolutely anything on it.
Does anyone know a software or smth that can bypass screen time without fully

called cuz i haven't done it for ages

tell me when i have ""5 mins left"" on an app and then never actually lock. not

How Can I Disable Screen Time,"How Can I Disable Screen Time

controls, please let me know, thank you.

 Sorry bro I'm pretty good with tech but I got nothing. 
 
     That’s alright😅



 I know this may not be what you want to hear, but your parents are doing you a
favour in a way. The thing is, humans are not entitled to the internet or screen
access 24/7 or even at all, but the new age has made it seem like it’s that only
one true thing that matters, FALSE! Your parents are doing you a favour by
limiting screen time, at your very young age, 13, it’s even more reasonable, and
I don’t feel bad for you. I wish my parents had done the same, so they tried,
but they never won against my bantering, now at the late stages of my teen
years, I’m trying to make up lost time, social development I should have had at
ages 15-16, lost, now I’m trying to make up lost time, hobbies, friendships and
relationships, academics, and the present day, now, not the past. I was a huge
history fan in my early teens, I still enjoy history, but not in a unhealthy
way, researching on my phone till the next morning and then playing video games,
I focused so much on the past, on missed answers and how the world was and will
be in the future, but I never focused on the current day, right now, LIFE. 
 
     I agree! Thank you for the advice!😁

     Yeah no I don't agree with this comment. 6 or 7 sure but not 13+.

Screen Time Restrictions,"Screen Time Restrictions

I (15f, will be 16 soon) still have sceen time on my phone when it seems like
none of my friends do anymore. It's limited to one hour of socials and one hour
for entertainment and games as well. The whole category only having one hour
pains me. I could spend 20 minutes on tik tok, 20 minutes on instagram, and 20
minutes on messages and all social apps would be locked for the rest of the day.
I've talked to my parents about possibly adding more time or taking the passcode
away all together but it's impossible to negotiating with them because they
honestly don't care to hear my opinion on things. They openly admit to running
our household like a dictatorship and anytime someone tries to speak up about
something things are threatened to be taken away. They did say that if I proved
I could handle my screen time on my own they would possibly consider reduces the
limitations, but I don't know how I'm supposed to do that when these
restrictions are set up. I rarely ask for the code as it is and most of the time
I don't use it all up. I also tried to explain to them how strict parents
usually create sneaky children who then go on not knowing how to make decisions
for themselves in the real world, but its so difficult trying to explain
something to someone who just doesnt want to hear it or doesn't care. My dad
called my stupid for explaining all that to them and said that the restrictions
set in place actually get me into the habit of not being open my phone a ton.
But he was proven terribly wrong a few weeks ago when my brother somehow got the
passcode (it's the same for all our Apple devices) and gave it to me. So I would
put it in when my hour was up and I ended up spending 10 hours a day roughly on
Netflix (this was over Christmas break so i had nothing better to do). My exact
thoughts during this time were to 'make the most of it' and watch as much as I
wanted cause I knew they would find out and change the code.  Sorry this is so
long but I've been dealing with this for years and I'm just so done. I might
just have to wait till I'm 18 to not have screen time.  If anyone has any method
of turing off or getting the code on iPhone please let me know. (I've tried
screen recording but it blurs the keyboard)

 Average parents L, see if one of your friends has a phone they don't use (make
sure to not connect to home wifi)

My gf broke up with me and out fucking screen time limits on my phone,"My gf broke up with me and out fucking screen time limits on my phone

Holy fuck, so I just posted abt how my gf broke up with me because of a
basketball “who’s the goat” discussion, went onto block blast to grind the
trophy (my high score is 27000+ btw), and then it ducking shut off because of
screen time.  I was really confused because I didn’t have a parent account
linked to my phone, so I checked in settings and… lemme just give you the story
So a couple months ago, we were hella drunk, and I was laying on her, feeling
the cushions of her… nvm it’s not important, but I was saying how much she was
my “mummy”. This is super embarrassing but it’s like lowk necessary for the
story.  Anyways I was calling her this, and I was in settings and was like “we
should start a family”, kind of joking (kind of) so that she would say “what!!”
and then I would be like “no in Apple 😂😂” and then she would be like “oh haha”.
And it actually did go like that’s except instead of saying “oh haha”, she said
“hand it over”  Long story short, she added herself as my “mummy” on Apple
family shit or whatever, I don’t understand it tbh.  So after we broke up, she
found out she could see my screen time and decided to add in screen time limits
to shit I barely ever use like Strava, MacroFactor or Apple health, all that
useless shit. But she also heavily limited YouTube and Block Blast!!!!!!! (BAD
BAD BAD 🚨🚨🚨)   And worst of all, she COMPLETELY blocked Spotify and Apple Music
because I was talking to her about how I was SURE carti would drop tmr, and now
I WILL NOT KNOW, like I’ll only see it on reddit (unlimited, thank god), and
then not be able to hear it!!!  So like… how do I fix this. I’m on summer
holidays and she’s blocked me, and I don’t want to talk through her friend (past
post why), so I don’t rly have contact. Any way for me to remove myself from
family or to bypass the limits?"

     Dude you have no idea whatsoever about how good or bad his parents are. Some parents are completely
    horrible to their children. I'm not by any means saying his are, I'm just saying you have a complete lack
    of information to judge him and the justifiability of his actions.

     To be very fair, you don’t owe parents anything for bringing you into this world. They made that choice.
    Parents can be shit. You don’t have to tolerate or respect shit people.   You don’t know what OP’s
    homelife is either.

How the heck can u bypass a screen time password,"How the heck can u bypass a screen time password

Basically my parents recently found out how much I was on my phone and
electronics, now there's a screen time password.  IDK what the password is,
tried the obv stuff and am now hella desperate.  &#x200B;  A man cannot survive
a Saturday on an hour of gaming.  I don't know how much longer I can last.

 help i just found out my mom added a screen time limit on ibispaint and im
having a mental breakdown bc so many of my hobbies arent even in my control
anymore  im literally so pissed why cant parents leave us alone and respect our
privacy 
 
     Dude mine just shut down fucking capcut while i was mid edit. Like the fuck bitch kids my age are out
    smoking shit i cant pronounce and im here tryna make a fucking squid game edit and u stopping me? Weed
    here i come   Sorry for the rant



 if they are on ios 12, you can get screen record it and then look at it (this is
what i did)  if they are on ios 13, ur fucked 
 
     This guy hacks

     DUDE THATS GENIUS

     wait on my iPad Air 2 I added the screen record function to control center do u know how to actually
    screen record

     Mine hides the password thing 



 This why my phone is set on a password my mom won’t ever get to know, and my
secret account passwords are protected by Face ID.  Sorry, but my mom ain’t
gettin pass the Home Screen, I’d rather my phone taken away then her gettin’
access to it.  She doesn’t take anyway, frankly she ain’t that smart about
phones and don’t even want my password. 
 


 if u have a mac u can dm me and i can give you terminal code 
 


 go to settings - general - date&time - turn off ""set automatically"" and set the
day one day ahead and the hour from am to pm 
 
     that is also blocked in ios 13 and the other way is more usefull

     It only works for downtime! Not time limits :(

     I can’t, i have fucking restrictions

[HELP] My Apple iPad Mini stopped working after I shot it 16 times with a .40 caliber handgun,"[HELP] My Apple iPad Mini stopped working after I shot it 16 times with a .40 caliber handgun

So I got this Apple iPad Mini from the Apple Store a couple of months ago and I
love it. I’d been looking to upgrade to Apple for a while, and I am astonished
by all the features they have (Previously I had been using a Nokia 105 2019 Dual
SIM, which was the previous piece of groundbreaking technology as of 2020). Did
you know that Apple iPad has a touch screen that you can control with your
fingers?!! No buttons!!! Fascinating. Apple is super underrated.  Anyways I
downloaded this one app called Jetpack Joyride and It took a minute to download,
but I entered it as soon as I could. Jetpack Joyride is a top tier modern game
where you control a guy with a jetpack on an obstacle course. It has RTX
graphics and like amazing rendering and lighting I think.   The problem started
while I was playing and I failed the first time- but it let me continue “for
free with ads.” Now I’m assuming the word “ad” is just short for “additional
life” and the developers of this game were so kind to go easy on me and let me
continue playing from the point I left off. But when I clicked it, it glitched
and started trying to sell me an easy-bake oven, which I was looking into
because I need to provide food for my family somehow, but I wasn’t there to
shop. Something broke.  Now, whenever something doesn’t work for me, I have a
really easy solution to it. For example, one time my father-in-law was talking
super loud on the phone while I was trying to read. So I pulled out my Beretta
96 .40 caliber handgun and aimed it at his mouth before I pulled the magic lever
and so suddenly he stopped talking! Amazing right?!! And I’ve never had that
problem since!  So I decided to try it on my new Apple iPad Mini. I pulled my
Beretta 96 .40 caliber handgun out of my pocket and fired 16 rounds straight at
the magic touchscreen and it stopped playing the commercial!  My Apple iPad Mini
hasn’t turned on since. I tried everything. I called Google on my old Nokia but
they kept talking about how I should search a web like it was some riddle- and
besides, ew! Spiders?! I also went to the Apple Store but as soon as I showed
them the problem and pulled out my Beretta 96 .40 caliber handgun to show them
what happened beforehand, everyone just put their hands on their head, fell
over, and gave money to me. I don’t want money, I want my iPad fixed.  I’m
desperate. Has anyone else’s Apple iPad Mini stopped working after shooting 16
full rounds of a .40 caliber handgun at the screen? And if so, how did you fix
it?

 have you tried putting it in rice? did you power it on and off? 
 
     Sir, my iPad will not turn on. And when I put it in rice it caught fire and made a buzzing sound.  It’s
    still broken btw



 that’s a normal bug, tell an employee and they’ll fix it 
 
     I tried but everyone screamed and gave me money



 return it back to apple and sue them for giving u a destroyed item 
 


 put it in water, then put it rice, then put it in oil, and then clean with
tissue paper, and then dump it into a toilet, and then piss on it, and then take
it out, and then throw it in the garbage bin. It should be fixed by then 
 


 A few months ago my dad smashed my ipad with a stick after he got mad at me
&#x200B;  It is now permantly broken  &#x200B;  he has yet apologized and to
this day I am still pissed

How can I limit my screen time with no exceptions?,"How can I limit my screen time with no exceptions?

My screen time is up to like 7 hours. I can’t get off my phone and need a hard
block for some apps. All I can find are parental controls, and apple on its own
lets you use as much as you want. Any tips? Any good parent control apps I can
use on myself?

 I deleted a lot of apps that took up a lot of my screen time, and it went down
by a few hours 
 


 Phones have become so essential that it’s become tough to imagine our lives
without them. What’s funny about this is that most people alive today can
remember a time when we didn’t have cell phones, let alone smartphones. While we
know that our phones have become a big part of our lives, many of us aren’t
aware of just how much time we spend looking at these devices. If you have tried
parental controls then you might want to try these third-party apps I found on
broadbandsearch posts which you can use to limit screen time. Familytime works
on android and iOS. Qustodio works on android, iOS, kindle, and nook. Web
watcher works on android and iOS. ESET parental control work for android. 
 


 I use the app provided by my carrier

i’m on an apple phone and i need to bypass screen time how do i do that

 Disable it by geting the password when u have screen time 
 


 I easily do that with my second phone  Doesn’t have service though and my mom
takes away both of them at night so yeah doesn’t really work 
 


 You could try a factory reset, but that's a little extreme 
 
     i thought about that but i don’t want to lose my data



 Sleep, then wake up and it’ll be over 
 
     i wake up at 5 in the morning and it ends at 7 in the morning



 if there's just time limits, try this:  ask your parent to set a downtime but
not lock the apps (its very important that you turn off block after dowtime) as
a 'reminder' for yourself not to use the phone at night. during the downtime,
you can ignore limits for the whole day and this will bypass any time limits. so
if you had a downtime from 10p to 7am, you could wake up at 6 and ignore limits
on all the apps you want to use that day. bonus, this might make your parents
feel like you're being responsible about your own screen time and they could
relax the limits later on. 
 
     this is only happening because i was forced into family sharing is there a way to get out of the screen
    time thing all together

 Don't but apple 
 


 I agree with the other people, u could get a better Android for less, but if ur
set on an iPhone, I'd go with whichever size is more comfortable. The xr is huge
compared to the x if I'm not mistaken. Both will have good battery life,
performance, etc. Or, if size doesn't matter, go with the cheaper one (probably
x at this point) 
 
     I know. But i've been using android for many years at this point and i am getting kinda bored with it. I
    just wanna switch things up.



 If you want a better screen and camera go x else to save more go xr 
 


 android better 
 
     I know. For me android is better but i wanna switch things up. I wanna try something new.



 X for superior specs, XR for cool wacky colours and an LCD display and thicker
screen bezels 
 


 Xr has a lower quality screen 
 
     Buy x



 i already have iphone x but it’s not worth buying. probably get an android
instead 
 
     Why? If i buy x i will buy it for 540 or 570 bucks. So not that bad.

I found a way to bypass screen time restrictions for Safari on iPhones and a way to browse Safari without leaving history,"I found a way to bypass screen time restrictions for Safari on iPhones and a way to browse Safari without leaving history

Found this when I was fiddling around with my phone. You will need a google
account. I don't know if this will bypass age restrictions on websites but it
might since it bypasses screen time restrictions. This works by opening a
separate window of Safari on your phone inside of settings so this does not
actually count as using Safari. Whatever you search in there will not be
recorded in Safari's history and the time you spend in there will only be
counted as screen time in the settings app. Functionality is limited because
there is no search bar at the top of the page or forward and back which can
result in inconveniences and is why all of the following steps are necessary. If
you exit settings in any way or lock your phone while Safari popup in settings
is open, it will close the popup, forcing you to redo all of the steps. I hope
this is helpful to you. If you have any questions or suggestions please feel
free to comment bellow. This works as of iOS 14.4 on 3/7/2021 on an iphone xr.
As an additional warning, some things may not be very responsive and slow within
the Safari popup so please be patient.  1. open settings 2. press the big
section all the way at the top that has your profile picture and your name 3.
press on the ""icloud"" section 4. press on ""manage storage"" 5. press on ""change
storage plan"". This will open a popup that lets you select a storage plan 6. go
to the bottom of the popup and press ""learn more"". This will open a apple
support page in another popup 7. on the top left of the apple support page press
the two white lines to open a navigation menu 8. press on the section called
""iphone"". This will take you to the product page for the iphone 9. scroll all
the way down and press the blue link ""other retailer"" right above the line that
says ""Copyright © 2021 Apple Inc. All rights reserved."" at the bottom of the
page. This will take you to another page that has 4 boxes arranged in a 2x2 grid
10. press the box that says ""Sales"". A prompt will come up asking for your zip
code 11. enter your zip code and press go. this will send you to a page with a
map and a list of retailers 12. press on any of the retailers on the list and a
popup will open on the map 13. press on the link that says ""website"" on the
popup 14. this will take you to the retailers website. Here you will need to
find the links to the various socials of the retailer (usually at the bottom).
These links are sometimes icons or logos (youtube play button, twitter bird,
.etc) instead of blue underlined text. This can be hard to find and different
for every retailer. If you can't find the link to their youtube page, restart
and try another retailers website. Keep trying until you find it. Use that link
to get to the retailer's youtube page.  15. once you are on the youtube page
sign in by pressing the blue sign in button on the top right 16. after you sign
in, press your profile picture on the top right corner 17. then press ""manage
your google account"" near the top. This will take you to a google account page.
18. scroll down all the way to the bottom and press privacy. This will take you
to the privacy page 19. on the top right next to your profile picture, press the
9 dots arranged in a 3x3 grid. This will open a popup showing icons of google
services 20. press the icon for google search in the popup. This will take you
to a blank google search page where you are free to browse!

how to get rid of it. I thought of resetting my phone but I think they’d know

 Just go to sleep? 
 
     Nah bruh fuck sleep. Plus it locks everything down at 9:30. That’s way to early. Those late hours of the
    night are my only time I can relax and talk to my friends maybe watch some tv or movies and not worry
    about my parents coming to yell at me. It’s my personal time. The only time I can just be myself and
    escape from my stupid life.



 You could always make a new Apple ID, that’s what I did. I control all my
settings. Now you’ll have to make sure if they put a passcode on your screen
time that you figure that out. Try asking to use their phone for something, or
try distracting them. 
 
     That’s not going to work. If I created my own Apple ID then they would still put screen time and
    restrictions on there I would just have my own ID. If I tried to resist that then they would just quit
    paying the bill or take it away when I slept. The only way I got rid of it the first time was my dad
    accidentally left the settings open so I went in and shut all of the shit off.



 Lmao, I know this is late, but I know a way to watch YouTube atleast. Dm me if
ur still interested lol.

 If you get a chance, try distracting them, food is good since it takes minutes
off from their notice, if one leaves their phone open then snatch it for a bit
and change settings, risky though but go for it if you really need it 
 
     I can’t change the settings though they have a passcode on it and I’ve tried everything I can think of
    that they would use nothing works.

anything except YouTube ads. 
 
     It blocks YT ads too if you open it in a browser. I use it on my Mac all the time! Even on iPhone I
    changed YT app with the Web app version with Adguard as extension so I don’t have to watch those horrible
    ads every 20 seconds

     is it secure tho?

     and for youtube ads, you can just use brave browser

     How?

     How do you do that?

     How does it compare to NextDNS?



 What kind of inside app ads i could possibly block with this? Any URLs to share
and maybe a little guide hiw to find this setting? (Propably somewhere under
screentime haha).  I only use reddit, Pogo(which has no ads anyways), brave
browser and some pogo related apps which either dont have apps so my experience
is quite ad free.  But could this maybe work to free youtube from ads or so?
That would make me actually use youtube on my phone hah! 
 
     https://obfusgated.com/tools/ad-block-test has a lot of examples of urls. But the one in the image is the
    one I’ve found most useful

     You can use YouTube in your brave browser to avoid their ads on your phone



 I mean if you use Safari you can just get uBOL 
 
     This works in apps though



 Or just use a free DNS service like [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) 
 
     The free tier doesn’t last long enough for me personally, 300k queries lasted about 2 weeks?

     Worth paying them like the 20$ for the year  However I’m still using free so I’m a hypocrite

     I use NextDNS, how do you block IN-APP ads?

     Or **ControlD** (free) if you don’t need much customization or logs. There’s no usage limit, it’s safer
    than NextDNS (no cache poisoning), and it’s a sister company of WindScribe. You can customize the filters
    without creating an account, for example the “Ads & Tracking + Malware + Phishing” resolver is
    https://freedns.controld.com/no-ads-malware-typo

     Shill?



 Sounds like a very manual pi-hole 
 


 I was just about to ask this. Thank you 
 


 Adblocks can do that too 
 


 how many billions urls would that be then?! 
 


 So you have to put each URL in an adblock list here?

 Apple needs to make this a thing and even on the non-X devices, it should not be

     Instagram's approach is the perfect one, they should just take the idea from them.

 Anyone have an informed perspective or inside info on why they haven't changed
the volume visualization yet???  I mean it's been a huge annoyance for nearly a
decade... it's kind of mind-blowing they haven't changed it yet, so there must
be some odd reason why they haven't done so. 
 
     Yeah, it’s so odd that a UI element that old and inconvenient has made through so many software revisions.

     i guess they feel they don't have to since app devs can do it themselves for their apps. They should at
    least make a discreet option available.

 Funny thing is in iOS 11 dev beta the Hud was gone and replaced for some simple
tweak that made the volume look like it does in Instagram videos.  When they
released the public beta, it was gone and the Hud was back.  Doesn’t even make
any sense. 
 


 this has been posted like 6 times now 
 
     Ooops, didn't know. Oh well, the more it gets around the better.

     Yeah, but this one of the few things that everyone seems to love to talk about.  If they actually changed
    the volume indicator, this sub would lose like 20% if its content.



 Going to against the grain on this one:  I don’t think Apple’s solution is
perfect, but I often think my volume buttons are broken when I’m in Apollo or
other apps with minimal UI because I’m not seeing the button presses register.
This is largely when audio is not actually playing, when I’m turning it down
before I think something may play.  I miss the iOS 6 overlay, its the blur that
makes Apple’s current version obnoxious for me. 
 
     Blue?

     That’s something you can adjust to. It’s just a different place to look for it.

     I tend to agree. I oft wonder if my volume indicator is working when, say, playing a video on Twitter (I'm
    guessing Twitter's custom indicator is broken, like everything else). And when I'm needing to quickly
    glance at my volume to adjust it, it's instrumental to have a large overlay over a discreet small one.

     I agree. There is a better way to do apple's popup, but this is not it. It's way not obvious enough,
    especially on a screen tall like that   Apps that show a bar with no volume icon are even stupider

     > I often think my volume buttons are broken when I’m in Apollo or other apps with minimal UI because I’m
    not seeing the button presses register.  I thought I was going crazy for a while but I'm glad to hear it's
    not only me thinking this.

     You’d most likely get used to it if it was changed system wide as it’s generally unexpected in apps but
    not system wide.

     Is the first app safe to use? Like it won’t steal your info? Or what exactly does it do? Just store things
    for you?



 My condolences. It's always very heartbreaking to hear such news. 😭 Stay strong!
💪🏼 
 


 So very sorry for your loss 
 


 Omg I can’t answer your question but I am so sorry for your loss. ❤️ 
 


 If the screen recording has audio on it use iMovie select the clip and under
audio hit detach audio and then delete the video portion and then export your
audio 
 


 It's truly disappointing that this feature is missing.. I'm sorry for your loss.
I hope you get better soon. Stay strong. 
 


 Sorry for your loss. May he rest in peace in heavily comfort🙏 I had quite the
same issue with my son passed away because of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. I
used deep fake to create his voice but it doesn't sound 100% him. At least i
have something close to his voice...

Lock screen and status bar showing one minute time difference.,"Lock screen and status bar showing one minute time difference.

As you can see, the lock screen shows 11:11 and the status bar shows 11:10. I’ve
been noticing this happening for some time now.  What could this be and how do I
correct it?

 I’ve seen this a couple of times on my phone in the last few months. Thought I
was going crazy. 
 
     Thank you! Everyone else thinks I’m trolling!



 Happened to me also 
 
     Time isn’t always accurate  There were some times it got stuck on a minute

     Happy cake day!



 I’ve seen this before, but it only lasts for a few seconds max. Was yours
constantly a 1 minute difference? 
 
     Lmao, one night mine was three minutes off. My watch said one time, my phones main said another and the
    lock screen said a different time.

     Only lasted a few seconds, yes.



 Isn’t that green bubble number supposed to be the duration of the phone call
instead of current time? 
 
     [deleted]

     Green bubble only tells you you are on a call and you can tap it to quick switch to the call. Wether it be
    your phone, discord, Snapchat, Instagram, etc.   Blue bubble implies location and when tapped, shows what
    app is using your location.  I feel like I’m talking about MTG

     Nope

     Nope. It just replaces the green bar that was present with pre-X iPhones but it actually shows the time.

     Can also mean that hotspot is turned on

     No man, the call started at 10:52, it is definitely the time. Has happened a few times earlier as well.

     That’s never been the case, why do people keep saying this? Do you guys ever pay attention to what’s going
    on with your phone?

     Nope



 Charge your phone. 
 
     Hahaha yes yes it’s charged now. 😀



 That looks like you screenshotted a phone call at 11 minutes and 10 seconds
hence the green. Trolling? 
 
     That usually means hotspot.

     No man, the person I was on call with said “it’s 11:11(angel’s number), wish for something!” and I saw
    this and I was surprised to see two different times. Not trolling.



 I get the time either in the corner OR on my Lock Screen, but not in both places
at once. What software version are you on? 
 
     Same here. I’m on the latest version of iOS and I get the time either in one place or the other, not both.
    In fact I don’t ever recall the time being in both places at once on my iPhone.

     Yea ur right, never both

     I was coming on here just to say this. Also, when there is the green bubble in the corner, it is an active
    call. OP is probably trolling and took a screenshot when the call made it look like it was the time and it
    was off.



 My two cents is that one (or both) of those two time widgets might be programmed
to check the time not every second, but every period of e.g. 10 seconds (which
would be to save battery life), which causes them to display the new minute a
few seconds after it begins.  Due to that, it would so often happen that if the
two widgets were not created at the same time, their phases would not be aligned
(so the 10 seconds period of one widget ends, and then a few seconds later, the
10 seconds period of the other widget ends), and it's even possible that their
time checking frequency is not identical in the first place (e.g. one of them
checks the time every 10 seconds, while the other checks it every 5 seconds).
Either way, IMHO this is a minor issue and probably common in interfaces of all
kinds, and fixing it would require either forcing both widgets to check the time
every second (which would consume more battery) or somehow forcing the phases of
all time widgets on the screen to be aligned, which would necessitate extra
coding for such a minor nitpick.  So personally I would just ignore it (as the
end-user at least). Or if you think it's too bad, you can report it to Apple and
see if they would do something about it... 
 
     This, this right here is what I was looking for. Maybe it could be because my phone almost always stays in
    low battery mode and that causes the widgets to not sync(not sure how much of a difference it would make).
    My phone is charged now and I’ve removed i from low power mode so I’ll see if this happens again now.
    Thank you.



 Could it be the battery saving mode being on causing this? Maybe it’s refreshing
time not every second but on longer intervals when on. 
 


 sorry, it seems apple’s software is awful these days. i wish i could tell Tim
Apple how bad it is. usually bugs in Apple’s OS’s are on a quality cycle and
improves in time, but for the last several years, software quality has been
negative. so bad, in fact, that i switched my users at work from Mac to PC. they
lost focus on the little things. but the little things matter. steve jobs would
tell you every pixel counts. they lost focus on that.

I’ve never visited and apparently isn’t even a real website. Lol and all but it
would be nice if someone could actually be helpful 
 
     Well a CDN makes sense as it could be used for various types of content. Though any site that is being
    reported as that many hours per day would almost certainly be a bug

     The CDN in substackcdn usually indicates that this is a **c**ontent **d**elivery **n**etwork. Those are
    used by websites/apps to speed up loading times of assets like pictures, videos and other files by copying
    them around data centers and delivering requested files from a server that is near to your physical
    location.

 6:45 = 405 minutes per day this week  405/49706.58 = 0.0081 minutes p/d last
week.  0.0081*60 = 0.486 seconds p/d  0.486*7 = 3.402 seconds p/w total
(probably in one go)  Huh.  **EDIT:** Thanks to a commentor for reminding me to
convert to seconds as the most sensible unit! 
 
     r/theydidthemath

     0.0081 minutes * 60 seconds = 0.486 seconds  Its possible

     Quick maths

     0,486*7 = 3,4 seconds

     Per day this week so this week he spent 405 x 7 minutes so 405 x 7 /49706.58 = 0.486 x 7 seconds so around
    3,5 seconds

     It's actually half that because it was up by that percentage. For example, it's like saying you increased
    by 100%, so increasing 1 by 100% becomes 2.  Edit: Agh, I did an oopsy. /u/fhjkgk did it correctly by
    adding the 100%. I knew it didn't sit right, and had the right idea, but completely wrong answer :P

 APPLE WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION 
 
"
The “it just works” magic is fading,"The “it just works” magic is fading

I’ve had both Android and apple back and forth for like 15 years. The main
reason that I keep coming back to apple and have been on iPhone for the last 8
or so years is because stuff used to “just work”. Anything new they released was
flawless (nearly) in working as expected. Recently though, I’ve started to
notice a lot of android-esque glitches and it’s super frustrating. I just put my
watch on the charger, and the battery icon is still showing me the AirPods
charging (which are in a totally different room). The other day, while flipping
my phone for a video, it showed me this weird tiny horizontal screen the size of
landscape mode, but in the top right corner. Had to flip it back and forth a few
times before it displayed properly. AirPlay has been super inconsistent, often
requiring disconnect/reconnect and just hoping it works. Even the photos and
music apps keep glitching, the other day my music started playing on its own
after I stopped it and locked the screen. So many weird little bugs keep popping
up and I’m seriously getting tired of it all. I hope they go back to the “it
just works” magic and fix these issues.

 This is correct. iOS works swell but has lost its polish for sure 
 
     Shareholders demand a new release in October every year, polish be damned 

     I was talking to someone who was a long time former employee of apple who left for greener pastures but
    kept in touch with some folks. Their take was that toxicity in the workplace kept driving good talent out
    and less than stellar folks who were willing to stick it out stayed on and got promoted. Some of the
    achievements and quality levels they were cheering a couple years after they left were levels that they
    said they used to get flogged over when they were there.     Their take was that apple was riding on
    reputation but it was all bound to catch up sooner or later.    Glitches or no, a lot of folks also feel
    ""stuck"" in the ecosystem and admittedly being able to communicate with folks with a consistent icloud
    account even if your phone number changes is also a benefit. Like everything else, they will suck as much
    as thr public will allow them to while making money.

     This was an Android issue since it's inception..too many features, lot of different developing teams so
    lot of fragmentation. Now everything mostly just works. With android-esq of iOS it was bound to happen.

     Steve jobs would not let ts fly is all. The longer they go without him the less you can expect them to
    hold his values of delivering functional and finished products

     I  basically got a Google pixel instead of 16 because of all these bugs and oddities. iOS was annoying me
    on my 14 already as time went on, and I didn't see the point in having such a locked down system if itll
    perform like android anyway...

     Yeah I am feeling open to options for the first time in a while

     Yeah the moat is gone. I may switch because *whispers* who really cares?

     Android has also done a good job catching up. At least the flagships.

     iOS should be fairly stable but they keep breaking it.  Searching for app in settings app often result in
    nothing even though the app is there, as an example.  No way to find / edit blocked contacts, which is
    frustrating. So many small things don’t work.



 I've been buying iPhones and MacBooks exclusively since 2009 and I have
definitely noticed this too. It's frustrating. 
 
     Macos still works the same if not better than before (as long as u have up to date equipment) but ios is
    the problem. They have different teams even though they share resources like kernel code, drivers etc

     The last 2 or 3 versions of iOS are fucking killing me.

     Getting rid of the flippy clicky switch for silent or ring and replacing it with a button was a huge
    mistake. Never ever ever in the entire 6 years of having an iPhone have I had a problem with vibrate on
    silent mode. Recently upgraded and missed several calls already because my iPhone doesn’t vibrate on
    silent even though it’s enabled.   Yes I have Apple care, but this has literally never ever happened in
    the history of keeping my phone on silent for 6 years.  I am very sad about this as I love Apple, always
    have. Those multi colored desktops back in the day wooed me and the “just works” iPhone hooked me.

     Me too. Hell, my 2012 MacBook Air is more consistent than my 2nd gen iPhone SE.

     Same only i started with mbp2010, but last year someone asked me to help print something for them on their
    windows machine. And it was definitely not a plug and print like mac has been since 2010..   this was so
    frustrating to me because i have been told for 5years now that windows doesnt need you to install with
    cd/download/driver bullshit. But it still does.. i wouldnt be surprised if just plugging in a keyboard
    gives errors from hell.   Eventhough mac/apple goes a bit slow or is in a regression.. its still better
    working then a regular windows machine..

     The fact that I can’t keep the day & date showing in my menu bar without it randomly disappearing is a
    constant reminder of the declining software quality.

     imo the last true unbelievable stable MacOS was Snow Leopard.  So rock solid for audio recording and video
    editing.

     Lol pcs and android work just as well. You are in a bubble

11d73ffae76c454518ae483a3fc9a10a360223  Yeah had this happen earlier today.
Getting tired of crap like this and can imagine myself moving to Android one day
if it’s going to continue. 
 
     This is precisely the sort of glitches I’m talking about! Very frustrating

     The reason I haven’t moved to Android is my Apple Watch which has become an integral part of my routine
    and habit.

     This is the best glitch we have ever created!  -Tim

     If current day Apple thinks Steve would have let any of this ship (honestly anything past the X) they are
    absolutely insane.   The entire selling point and value prop of the entire product/ecosystem was OP’s
    title “it just works”.   This is just ten steps backwards.

     This has been going on for years and I can’t believe it’s still not fixed

     That’s been happening to me since the iPhone 7+, which was my first iPhone. Amazed it still happens.

     Yup this happens like once a day at this point

     Whoa, I’ve never seen anything like this. That’s a wild UI bug.

     Never experienced anything close to this bad on android. Barely experience ANY glitches on android these
    days.

     I never thought I’d say this but same. Siri is why I hate it so much aside from little annoyances like
    this and the keyboard being the most frustrating thing you’ll use each day

     Steve Jobs would die again if he saw this

     You might want to lower your expectations if you’re expecting different in the android world. I’ve gone
    back and forth since smartphones first came onto the market and as bad as Apple is getting, they’re still
    better than what’s going on in the android world

     Ugh I feel this. I watch a lot of stuff on my phone in my downtime and I have free rotate on for my
    screen. If I try to text while watching something it freaks all the way out and doesn’t like being
    sideways even though being sideways is literally a feature. Then when I switch it back it gets stuck like
    that.

     As someone who never had an iPhone and for some reason this post was in my feed, I'd just like to say what
    the fuck

     Lol this doesn't happen to me and I have a Samsung from 2020

     The grass is always greener. Android is a shit show. The subreddit is nothing but technical support
    requests.   Don’t assume it’ll be super smooth over there. Google is the king of shipping half baked
    solutions.

     I’m curious what iPhone and iPhone OS combination are you using?

     I already been there. Last year I bought a Samsung phone. It had more bugs than iOS. Android itself was
    fine but the apps were terrible. I bought an iPhone 15 after a few months because I just couldn’t live
    with it.

     Moving to android wont solve shit. It’ll just be slightly worse  In any case, that’s what the consumer
    wants or something

     I can't blame you for considering moving to Android but don't expect the grass to be greener. My wife has
    an S22 that's been showing she has 3 unread texts for over a year now. She even deleted all of them just
    to see if she missed something and those three ghost texts remain, forever unread.

     Beware, on Android it’s likely something like this happen consistently for months 😅 I remember Pixel 5 had
    an issue for which the whole notifications share was completely unreadable in dark mode, because of white
    text on white background. It took them like 5 months to fix it  But jokes(?) aside, that it’s
    inconceivable

     If you think you won’t get these kinds of bugs on Android, have i got news for you  edit: holy shit, i
    thought this was r/iphone, not r/android. Why the fuck are you hanging around the iphone sub if you hate
    is so much?

     Have you heard of restarting your phone once in a while? lol usually fixes these bugs



 They keep changing stuff just for the sake of change. 
 
     Apple has stopped worrying about polish and stability for the sake of just having ""new features"" because
    there's hardly any new advancements anymore for modern cell phones. All of these companies would highly
    benefit from stopping releasing new phones every year but we know this isn't happening.

     Re: the photos app  Having the two tabs of all photos and ""recents"" let you switch back and forth between
    your main full camera roll and favorites or another album. It's so weird to navigate now.

     Exactly! What was wrong with the photos app? As a UX designer it frustrates me even more, because its
    obvious they redesigned the app just for the sake of it without an actual problem to solve

     I am still very very very pissed they changed the timer from showing the end time to just show how much
    was set.  GOD DAMN SUCH A USEFUL FEATURE REPLACED BY UTTER GARBAGE JUST BECAUSE.

     Developers have to develop or…whatever happens

     This is true for pretty much every tech company these days. Toast rebranded to ""Local"" and it's annoying
    to remember every time that they rebranded.  Gotta justify every PM/PD salary somehow.

     I’m what is considered old now, I have worked in IT most of my life and the reason I am slower at IT
    things now is I have many dozens of versions of software I have experience with, so it takes time to
    figure out how *this version* does it, or even if it still has that feature.

     What would be amazing would be more areas of customization.

     100% this, by the time i get used to everything a new update comes and it’s completely changed.

     Like the calculator.   Literally took away the repeat operation via hitting “=“ and rendered it 90% more
    useless for me.

     That's the general trend in SW development these days. They don't have any big ideas anymore so people
    need to justify their employment by creating a lot of churn.

     The new photo album is complete ass and was just unnecessary.

     This right here. I wish they didn’t, but the shareholders need their profit. No time for something to
    marinate without another Change or release of something.



 Incoming call, but it won’t let you swipe to answer. Just fantastic when it
fails at being a.. phone. 
 
     every fucking time someone calls me I am swearing because it took 50 swipes to answer, or it answered
    properly but then the screen keeps toggling betwen off and on when I'm trying to put the fucking  all on
    speaker phone.   such a pile of shit.   thankfully apple doesn't want to make small phones anymore so once
    my 13 mini is too old to use, I'll take another almost certainly disappointing wade into android land

     There’s this new bullshit on iOS 18 my iPhone’s been doing where when I answer a call it’ll show that
    popup audio source menu. It used to only show up if you were actively connected to an external audio
    source, but now it shows up every time and “connects” my Beats by default even though they’re powered off.
    So I don’t actually hear any audio until I select “iPhone”. To make this worse, when I actually have my
    Beats on and receive a call, the call audio defaults to iPhone. Absolutely driving me up a god damn wall
    with this nonsense.

     I've had that bug since iOS 1 and I can't believe it's still there today.

     and voicemail has basically never worked... like how do you fuck that up?

     Yup, had that today

     Jfc that happened to me yesterday. Took 5+ tries to accept the call.

     Sometimes you press the screen lock button and it hangs up your call. Sometimes it doesn’t. What gives?



 Took me 5 minutes to disable Apple Intelligence given how shitty the
implementation was. 
 
     I don’t think I even have it yet. With all the negative reviews on it, I’ll just wait till I actually have
    some use for it or it becomes useful organically.

     I think that’s part of the issue. My 13PM has had zero bugs while others with newer iPhones seem to be
    having glitches.

     How do you disable it?

     I like how you can disable it but it’s still taking up 3GB of your storage like wtf? If it’s turned off it
    should all be deleted.

     [deleted]

     Honest question, is Apple Intelligence the first time they have released a product to everyone and called
    it a beta?



 One of Apple’s biggest issues is that the company as a whole has massive ADHD.
The moment they come up with something new to focus on, they abandon fixing any
remaining bugs in their previous hot new thing. 
 
     That’s because that’s how incentive structures work at big tech companies nowadays, in part driven by how
    investors value tech stocks. You only get promoted for the new shiny, the only reason you pay attention to
    anything else is if the bugs or tech debt gets so bad it can’t be ignored.

     I have a cynical theory (which is probably just a fact) that if something is bad, be it a feature of iOS
    or a meal at a restaurant, it’s because somehow it’s more profitable for it to be bad.  They’ve done the
    math that saving costs by sacrificing quality gives them a better margin than the reverse.   This take is
    mostly just the concept of Enshitification I suppose.

 They need an OS release like iOS 12, where the focus is on stability.  But at
this stage they’re too busy chasing the AI train 
 
     I’m so sick of the AI train. Most of that train is technically machine learning anyway.  But I don’t want
    AI nonsense or generated art nonsense.  I just want to be able to do normal things.

     100% This stuff! Never was an issue before



 Oh 100% I work at a carrier and the amount of iPhone 16's we've had to replace
as an Out Of Box failure due to IOS fucking up is insane.  The main issues we've
found are basically that it'll glitch while transferring and the new phone will
get so hot it can't do shit and basically breaks. It's ridiculous.  Also Phone
Transfers on iPhones are horrid compared to Samsung's, Samsung to Samsung you
plug the two phones into each other and that's easy as, iPhones have so so so
many issues for dumb reasons, like the prompt to transfer just doesn't always
show up. Stuff just breaks now. 
 
     Yes! I’ve experienced this when upgrading my dad’s phone. New phone got stuck somewhere in the process
    after like an hour or so of work. Had to figure out how to do a hard reset and start over. Took like 3
    hours total of having both his phones.

     God forbid they have the security delay turned on and forget their password

     I deal with data migration of multiple devices (usually Apple-to-Apple, or Android-to-Android, but cross-
    system migrations are becoming more of a thing of late) and I will happily get 2 Apple migrations done in
    the time of a single Android one. Usually.  And I tend to have FAR more reliable results and processes
    with the Apple stuff.  But that's just me.

     YES! I had to replace my new 16 because it didn’t transfer 100% and then it stopped charging. It was so
    odd.

     Android to Android used to be absolutely terrible. Glad to hear it’s a little better now

First time visiting Google Store and It reminds me of Apple instantly,"First time visiting Google Store and It reminds me of Apple instantly

Where is the innovation, Google?

 It's all the same these days 
 
     Popular consumer products all eventually evolve into the same product, but with different badges -- cars,
    clothes, shoes, etc.

     Reminds me when suddenly every company was using [corporate memphis](https://i.imgur.com/VzkQxqX.jpeg)

     It’s undeniable that Apple set the marketing standard for the industry—even other industries.

     Everything converges on the lost sellable style eventually. And it’s not just Google copying Apple they
    are converging together.

     Convergent evolution?

     Unrestrained Capitalism requires infinite growth. This is what the end stage looks like. To keep
    projecting growth, you have to cut costs and broaden appeal. Thats why things formerly good products get
    worse and everything homogenizes leaving us with identical copies of worse things for more money.

     Convergent Engineering

     Well yeah been that way since 🤔 07 black berry ⛈️ 🤔

     Android still just handles notifications better   Idk I carry 2 phones now a days , 2phonejones over here

     Been like that since the Black berry

     No, apple us going from many days



 I don't like Android as a product but I'm very glad it exists in the sense that
Apple with a complete monopoly on smartphones would not be good for anyone.
Ideally, I wish Blackberry or Windows Phone had been able to establish
themselves as a viable 3rd player in the space so we weren't left with a
duopoly, but here we are. 
 
     I do like Android, and I like how both iOS and Android have a symbiotic relationship. Every time one OS
    gets something useful you can bet the other one will get it soon. Like iOS copying the Notification Center
    and Android copying Do Not Disturb. Both OSes need to exist to keep interesting features coming for all
    consumers.

     *""Ideally, I wish Blackberry or Windows Phone had been able to establish themselves""*     As a Canadian I
    do too... I do too 😢

     it’s unfortunate windows and blackberry took too long to respond to the first iphone. google and android
    responded immediately and here we are….   there’s some cool documentaries on it

     I held out for what felt like quite a while hoping Nokia would release something with a decent touch
    OS/screen.   Ended up with a 4.   See if I could get an iPhone Communicator I’d be _very_ happy!

     Agree; You can always think about a feature from your competitors and still implement it your way. I can't
    wait to see iOS 26 next month.

     What don't you like about Android ""as a product""?

     I have android and iPhone and think android is better in every way. I can respect that opinion

     Windows Phone was such a missed opportunity.

     Well in the end Google, Samsung and others pay Apple 20 cents per phone because of licensing multi-touch
    patents and other patents. Also there was a couple of multiyear court cases that Apple won.

     I hate Android for that everything they now - is copying iPhone. Everything, including bad decisions. It’s
    not real competition, it’s copying.



 This is so cringe. Apple and Google have been copying each other for years. 
 
     I don't understand this post lol. You go scroll a lil further on this sub you'll see people saying apple
    copied pixels camera ""visor"" and made it uglier.

     Android is a complete copy of the iPhone. It was supposed to be a feature phone operating system. When the
    team saw what Apple had done, they delayed and tried to rework Android with as much as they could copy
    from the iPhone reveal. It took *years* to even approach feature parity, and it was still short for a few
    more. There are documentaries on the birth of Android if you didn’t live through it.  I gotta respect
    Microsoft for going in an entirely different direction with Windows Phone. I wish they stuck it out,
    because it was far more polished than Android at the time, IMO, and had compelling features without being
    a resource hog. It also wasn’t a blatant ripoff of the iPhone.

     Apple doesn't copy google...



 Imitation is the new innovation. 
 
     Has been for many many years now

     That's all Apple does with iOS updates lol.  Features that have been on Android for years and Apple
    finally includes them in a ""major release"" and claims they're the innovative ones



 The truth is, most companies imitate Apple from their website design to their
phone design because it's the most desired smartphone brand in the world. 
 
     As someone who works in web design, I get sooooo many briefs that list an Apple product page as the
    inspiration. Usually they don’t have the assets or budget to make something like that 😂

     Everybody copies everybody

     Yep. Samsung became number 2 by copying to the limit everything Apple has made. Samsung phones. I know
    they are a huge conglomerate but they do this across product lines. It’s not surprising at all Google or
    any other OEM does this. I will say tho, I’ve gotten day one iPhone deliveries consistently since that was
    a thing…. I cannot say the same for many other companies

     Everyone copies Apple. Or is it Apple is never first but they do it the Apple way? Or is it we should just
    wait for the next iOS release? 



 Whoever is most popular gets copied 
 


 Ask Samsung the same thing. S23 ultra was the last remnant of innovation for
them. 
 
     S23 - S25 Ultra are the same exact phones with some minor aesthetic changes.



 Google and Apple are just becoming one singular phone company, Google copies the
website and the features and apple copies the pixel style 
 
     Under the skin, they function and operate with very different motivations as discrete platforms.

     What pixel style did apple copy?   isn’t pixel the one which made pixel 9 look like iphones with the flat
    design?

My Alarm Redesign,"My Alarm Redesign

Hi! this morning i was thinking… why the alarm on the iPhone is so bad? I’m not
talking about the ringtone but the design… the visibility and order of the
buttons just feels… wrong! so i made a real quick concept on how i would like to
see the actual alarm on my iphone. (I know it's certainly not a professional
redesign, I did it in 10 minutes on the phone just to give an idea of ​​the
features I would like, if you would like the redesign well done with animations
too I will do it!).  first of all to do a redesign we have to talk about the
problems, the solutions that we can provide and the functions that we want in
this new design. - the alarm doesn't look like an actual alarm - the buttons
feels wrong - why the “snooze” is not very visible? - bro i want to see the TIME
when the alarm sound - lets use more the dynamic island - I don't want to change
the iconic design too much - the “STOP” must have a significant action that
indicates that we are lucid enough to stop the alarm, otherwise we will go back
to sleep with the snooze which must be easier to press - let’s use the ON/OFF
button of the iphone like a real alarm clock of the nightstands (especially in
standby mode)  let me know what u think and if you want a real redesign and not
just a concept, ill send the comparison and the full screen designs so you can
feel them on you’re iPhone.

 Please can they make the lockscreen buttons bigger. Ive accidentally hit snooze
too many times instead of stop and having my phone blast at full volume mid way
through a shower. 
 
     If youre actually awake check your home screen again. If theres still an alarm pending just swipe left to
    cancel it. The big bright snooze is to prevent half asleep people turning off the alarm and miss it.

     “Hey siri, stop”

     My wife every freaking morning. It’s so frustrating.

     I’ve done this and my cat is screaming in my room with my alarm going off

     I specifically turn off the option for snooze to not be there. Get up when the alarm goes off first.

     You'll like what Apple engineers or get out.

     hey check the final redesign is out now!

     If I take my phone off the charger it turns the alarm off.

     android shows your alarm snoozed in notification centre. so it’s pretty easy to turn off all alarms for
    the day before you get into the shower   iphone makes you click 5 buttons and turn it back on afterwards.
    ridiculous

     ""Hey Siri, turn off my alarm!""

     You can turn off snooze entirely (per alarm) if you don’t use it.

     That’s by design

     you can disable snooze on any alarm but its enabled by default. If you do this, the big snooze button will
    turn into a stop button

     Night showers prevail for this reason.

     Yeah but that’s why there’s a massive distance between the two, so you can’t accidentally hit one while
    trying to hit the other

     Thats a far better problem to have than coming late by accidentally pressing stop!

     lol same.  You can say “hey Siri, Stop” and it will stop.

     “Hey siri, turn off all alarms”

     Yelling at Siri to stop the alarm works in the shower.

     The most annoying thing is that the snooze and stop buttons are on the opposite side of, replay and stop
    buttons on a timer. In my sleep I’ve thought that the small button is the snooze button and ended up being
    late

     Get an apple watch then

     Deleting the live activity of the snooze will stop the timer

     I did not know there was a stop button tell now  I always open the alarm app to stop it  ...  :)

     I mean, it would be worse if you accidentally hit stop and then go back to sleep for another hours



 I can get behind the first one but the Dynamic Island one just feels it would be
so annoying no offence the design is good but not for the Dynamic Island 
 
     You don't even need it to be that big. I don't like the concept but I get the idea to make snooze easy to
    hit when you're waking up  But if your phone is unlocked and you see the dynamic island... yeah you're
    probably awake already, no need for it to take up your whole ass screen

     thanks! what would you recommend for the dynamic? this is just a concept to collect people opinion and
    create an actual redesign so your opinion would be a lot

     hey check the final redesign is out now!

     It's the new Dynamic Continent®️



 Keep the stop button and the snooze button in the same order in every spot 
 
     you are right i’ll follow this suggestion in the actual version thank you very much

     Have you ever adjusted your preferred content size? Crank it up to max and your phone native UI will look
    pretty much like this.

     hey check the final redesign is out now!



 I understand the reasoning for wanting the larger buttons but this looks nothing
like Apple's design language and in their eyes would look terrible. 
 
     Kinda agree. However I LOVE the idea of making the stop button a slide-to-stop, and the concept can
    absolutely be built into Apple's design language.

     [removed]

     iOS 18 looks nothing like their design language either so might as well.

     Was gonna say the same. Ugly and uncesscary but respect the effort.

     This is a feature that would be great for accessibility. For the average user, like many here have said, I
    just use the volume buttons to snooze if I need to. So, I don't really think its necessary. Perhaps
    configuring the stop button to activate only after a long press could address the issue of preventing
    accidental stops.

     hey check the final redesign is out now!

     [deleted]



 I just press the Volume Up/Down and it snoozes. Why mess with the screen when
you want to snooze? 
 
     Mine used to do this and now it snoozes AND silences the alarm half the time. It’s awful.

     Why risk dropping the volume so you might miss the alarm?



 Knowing myself the Snooze button should be less accessible 
 


 ₛₜₒₚ   #Snooze 
 
     ———— ₛₜₒₚ  ## Snooze



 Current design is subtle. This feels obnoxious. I only use the power or volume
buttons and never the on screen buttons anyway. 
 
     Oh interesting. I was gonna say i mostly wish they’d stop the physical buttons from interacting with the
    alarm

     I thought this redesign was like a shitpost at first. Are we sure it’s serious?

     But it’s an alarm. Obnoxious is kind of the whole idea. Otherwise you have Reminders.

 This has been a common complaint ever since they rolled out this design and they
have yet to change it. I agree, it's bizarre and stupid that it's not there. 
 
     Hopefully, there’s a fix in iOS 18.

     Don't you see it right before you pull this down?

     Damn, I never noticed until seeing this.  What an odd choice.

 Trying to see the date as well is seemingly more difficult. 
 


 Pretty stupid design. And swiping down the notification drawer all the way down
just to see the time is stupid as well.   I wish it was like android where the
first thing you see is the clock/battery then the rest of the shade appears. 
 


 That has been a pet peeve of mine for a long time now. Having to swipe from the
top to see the time but having to swipe from the bottom (I've got an SE) to see
the battery is just weird 
 


 There is a reason, it's called Apple ""we don't do that here"" 
 


 It sure does right? Other obvious thing… No way to access settings from here.
Have to waste an icon slot on a screen. 
 
     There is a way to access settings by holding the wifi button and then clicking wi-fi settings. Of course
    its inconvenient af but there is a way.

     Apple are so far behind android on UX design it's not even funny at this point



 That's Apple design for you. Everything requires more work. 
 


 Well honestly I can’t remember the number of times I’ve swiped down to open the
control center to check the time and have been disappointed. Idk why my brain
kept making me open it.

 Mine is camera. So what i did was disable the raise to wake. 
 
     I’ve disabled both raise to wake, and tap to wake. Pressing the power button is easy enough, and
    accidental input to the screen never happens anymore.

     For me the better solution was to set the flashlight and camera buttons to have to be pressed for longer
    before they activate

     Same here.

     I activate the camera when dismissing notifications on the Lock Screen, especially if a new notification
    comes in as I’m doing it.   Why are there two ways to turn on the camera on the Lock Screen?

     Mine is accidentally skipping music track to halfway through every time I put my phone in the pocket.
    Stupid iOS 16 redesign for bringing the music player to the bottom of the screen.



 Loving your wallpaper! 
 
     Thanks. Here’s the link.   [wallpaper.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bUuDsqAoxYUvAMRV9)



 Honestly, I feel like the flashlight button on the Home Screen is too HARD to
get to work. I have to really long press for both it and the camera button to
work. 
 
     Same. It hardly works even when I long press it and it randomly turns on when I don’t even touch my phone!

     Man I miss 3D touch it was perfect for that

     Camera just swipe left.

     I just swipe down for control centre, takes less time then fumbling around with that button that doesn’t
    work

     I missed the 3-D touch screens

     Try waiting for the wake animation to completely finish fading in before holding the flashlight button.

     there’s an option in settings for how long you have to hold for. for me i just had to hold for about half
    a second.

     Same here. I saw the post and was like “it’s a you thing” and then was shocked to see so many people with
    the same issue. Apparently I just have weak thumbs

     I use the “double tap on back of phone” to turn on and off the flashlight now. Works pretty good.
    Accessibility > Touch > scroll to the bottom > Back Tap

     For a long time, I didn’t think those buttons worked!

     Probably doing it wrong

     For real I don’t even bother using the lock screen. I use the control panels.



 All the time. I think a big design flaw for the iphone over past few iOS
versions. I’m personally not sure what I think about a lock screen with active
buttons on it - sort of contradicts the purpose of a LOCK screen. 
 
     Because it was designed for 3d touch screen when you need to press it hard to activate. Moving to haptic
    touch (basically long press) without something to prevent accidently register it is kind of lazy and bad
    decision IMO.



 iPhone 13 user here. Same issue. Every time I pick up my phone, “LUMOS” and then
everyone around me is frickin blinded because the flashlight decides it needs to
stay on. 
 


 Yes. why Apple doesn’t let us turn that shortcut off is beyond me 
 


 I miss when these buttons were 3D Touch on older phones instead of Haptic Touch
like they are today. You could see them react to the pressure, they’d just sort
of bounce if you didn’t press them hard enough. And as long as you pressed in
the right spot with the right amount of pressure they would work. Helped
minimise accidental presses too. 
 
     This right here, getting rid of 3D Touch felt like a step backwards in time.

     It was so perfect. Felt like an actual button being pressed with the force it needed, now it’s just a
    press-and-wait and I hate it.

 I often accidentally turn it on when getting my phone out of my pocket at the
gym. I fear the day I end up doing accidentally and end up being labelled a
creep for filming women. 
 
     Same. Sometimes I would feel my pocket is getting extra warm. And will notice my torn is on for the whole
    time.

     This is the reason why I turned on then promptly turned off the accessibility feature of having the camera
    flash light up when a text or call would come in.



 I miss 3D touch, it was so much easier to control these two lock screen buttons

     Happy it worked for you!

     Try again in 60 minutes

     Just to be safe you should perform a reset on your brother also.

     So do you still have a brother?

     How did you get a new brother so quick!?

     Wait your 10 year old brother set up your dads phone before? lol

     Congrats!

     The next step is to throw your brother in the garbage

     You can set to erase after 10 failed attempts so if it happens again you can just restore after

     I hope you told your parents that they should have used protection 10 months before your brother was born.
    J/K. Jokes aside, someone did that to me at work, I kicked him in the extremities and got fired at work.
    Worth it.

     I was going to say I recommend waiting 60 minutes but nevermind glad you got it :)

     The good ending 🔥

     Stay safe man 💙✨

     Hopefully, this will be a good lesson to the 10 year old

     Huzzah!



 Log into your iCloud from another Apple device. Find your device on ‘Find my
iPhone’, remote wipe it.  Then do the restore process with your iCloud and reset
up with whatever PW you want. You WILL have to input your existing iCloud PW to
restore the remote wiped device tho. 
 
     You can just change the screen time passcode from the parent account. I’ve had to do it a hundred times

 You can still put it in DFU mode and plug it into a windows machine but will
need the iCloud passcode to reset it 
 
     How do I get it in DFU mode?



 Plug it into a pc with iTunes or a Mac in the finder and just restore it. It’ll
ask for the iCloud password but I think it’s safe to assume he knows it since he
logged in. I believe restore mode on the 7/8/SE phones is hold down power button
and volume up until it restarts, then once the Apple logo comes up release power
but keep on the volume button. I could be wrong on that it’s been a while
personally but a PC icon should pop up, then plug it into the computer and
iTunes/finder will say “iPhone has a problem and needs restored” or something
along those lines and just hit restore. At the end it will ask for the iCloud
password like said previously but then your good. You have to put it in restore
mode or DFU mode (the same kinda but more steps) or else it will require the
screen time code to restore. 
 


 Unable to reset with Apple ID password? 
 
     They say they “don’t have it”.

 They don’t call it the daily mail for nothing! 
 
     All-day-ly mail

     They call it the Daily Heil because they supported Hitler… and still would!



 it’s probably forcing itself to run in the background for whatever shady reason
it wants, also make sure safari is all the way closed. 
 
     Thanks for the reply.  I had closed all the apps and reset it and the problem persisted.  Seems a hard
    reset has resolved it though.  Fingers crossed.



 This happens to me as well with random websites. I think its an ios15 thing.
It’s been happening since i got the beta. 
 
     [deleted]

     I've had the same experience but it's been happening pretty much ever since I've had my iPhone 12. So for
    me at least it was an iOS 14 thing too

     Happened to me on ios14 also. I ended up limiting the site to one minute per day (as someone else said).



 My screen time has been screwed up for a while now, most of my days it reports a
24h screen on-time :/ apparently I spent 24h on fox13now.com lol  Edit: Ok, I
fixed it lmao. Go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data, then
just restart your phone. This is going to remove all the weird sites appearing
on Screen Time.  I recognized the websites hogging the majority screen time are
the links I happen to open on in-app browsers (like Twitter and Discord in my
case). Not sure what's causing it, only started happening when I upgraded to iOS
15. 
 
     hmmm, so that means, the links we open in reddit for example just hang in them caches somewhere even when
    we kill the app ?  would using private mode on safari fix that ?

     Hello fellow Utahn

     Thanks that fix worked for me including with retrospective ScreenTime stats it seems (I only checked the
    past few days though).  I see the same thing you did that the sites I saw in ScreenTimes are ones I opened
    using in-app Safari in Twitter, Apollo and so on. I use Chrome the rest of the time.



 Is because dailymail is always refreshing on background its also a terrible news
source just remove it 
 
     There's no ""removing it"".  I don't have any dailymail app.



 I mean it’s kind of a tabloid but I don’t see why you’re so embarrassed as to
lie about this OP. It’s fine (though weird) to spend a lot of time reading
DailyMail. 
 
     My biggest shame.  😭

     You're not British are you?



 Oh dear. The Daily Fail has infected your iPhone! It needs a dose of something
factual to kill this bug. 
 


 Same dude, mine shows a porn site but i actually never use it…I like have no
idea where it CAME from but i hope apple fixes this bug. 
 
     No but we know what you CAME too after haha 😂



 I posted the same issue here too! I have the same problem. Definitely some iOS
15 bug, imo 
 
     Agreed.  I recently updated.



 I had the same thing with The Onion. I opened it during the day and when I
checked screen time showed it had been open all night somehow. Happened the
following night too. I restricted the website to 1 minute and it hasn’t happened
again  Edit: oh I just saw that you did too. Nice 
 
     The onion probably has more facts in it than the daily fail/heil/lie/hate-mail.

"I bought an iPhone 16, and I have absolutely 0 « wow » effect.","I bought an iPhone 16, and I have absolutely 0 « wow » effect.

I’m a long time iPhone user.   - my first iPhone was an iPhone 3GS.  - then, I
bought an iPhone 4. The feeling was awesome. It looked like the future in his
time.  - he randomly died when iPhone 6s was already out, but I bought the 6
(cheaper). Then again, amazing feeling. Bigger but not too much. Thin, light.
Touch ID. Wow.  - the 6 slowly became unusable. I bought a brand new iPhone Xr.
This time again, the wow effect was there. Face ID instead of touch ID. The size
which is (IMO) perfect for a phone. All screen and almost no edge. Wow.  Here I
am now. My iPhone Xr still almost works like it’s brand new. Battery is at 88%
after all these years. I just bought an iPhone 16 for better photography, iPhone
Xr being very limited on that side.  But appart of photography ? Absolutely no
excitation. Absolutely no wow effect. Absolutely nothing.  Apple intelligence ?
Is a piece of sh*t and couldn’t care less about it anyway. Haven’t even
activated it and just wish apple will allow us to delete the space it takes on
the phone.  iOS future MaJ ? Well if Apple could release an update without bug
and with the se attention to details than before, I would care about it. That’s
not the case anymore.  Dynamic island ? Absolutely useless compared to the
notch.  Hardware ? Hardware specs are already enoght for common use since years.
It really makes me realise there is no evolution anymore about iPhone. The 16 is
basically an Xr with better photo lenses.  I can see that when I watch keynote.
« best ever this », « best ever that », « amazing », blablabla… But on a daily
basis ? For John Doe use ? Nothing.  I don’t know if Apple is not able to
innovate anymore. I don’t know if smartphone has just peaked in terms of shape
and performance for normal people. What I know is that I see absolutely no
reason to spend so much money in it to change it if it wasn’t for planned
obsolescence or failure. Here I am with my new phone, and I’m just glad I was
able to have it for a good price.

 You are far from the first to make this observation. At this point, replacing a
phone or computer is basically more of an inconvenience than anything else.
The days of anxiously awaiting the release of a new device are gone. I’ve not
seen anything to get excited about in probably 6-7 years. 
 
     Best new tech I got in the last year was the Bose Open Ultra earbuds. Felt like the same magic I had when
    I got AirPods for the first time or an iPad.  Being able to listen to good sounding music without my ears
    being blocked still trips me up to this day.

     Having lived through the widespread adoption of the internet and cell phones, it feels weird that advances
    in consumer tech have stalled like this. AI seems like the thing everyone’s anticipating—but no one seems
    to even like it. And most of the predictions about what AI will look like seem to be either completely
    underwhelming, or just a total jobless hellscape (no in-between).   The good news is we can do something
    about shitty corporate policies, especially when they’re being carried out by monopolies. We should break
    up Google, but we should also break up Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. And we should adequately fund
    basic research through federal grants and the university system—because that’s where technological
    advances come from.

     The Steam Deck I think was pretty great

     Thank you I’ve been saying this forever. Phones have gotten to the point where they are so good the phone
    wars and people hating that someone got the thing you don’t like doesn’t matter. l

     The wife just got herself brand new Samsung flagship and it’s been 2 months and she hasn’t changed her
    phone yet cos it’s so cumbersome. I’m still trying to justify getting a new iPhone over my se3.

     Hold up. I just got a new computer and it’s super exciting. Sometimes I just stare at it.  (Went from a
    2016 MacBook Air to a m2 MacBook Air)

     Wait wait wait. Have you NOT see the new *checks notes* camera bump on the iPhone 17?! That's going to be
    amazing and You're Going to Love It™️

     To each their own. I was excited going from my 13 Pro to my 16 Pro. Not like “omg I can’t wait” of course
    — but still…  It’s small, quality of life, things for me:   - The titanium body is noticeably lighter in
    weight and I like the more rounded edges - The camera button is the way I always wanted to open the camera
    (coming from Pixels before my 13) - The cameras are better across the board (albeit marginally), and the
    5x zoom is very welcomed - I like action button for turning on my flashlight (silent mode moves to the
    lock screen) - Love always on display - I like the visuals of the Dynamic Island (unlocking, now playing,
    etc), even if I haven’t really found it functionally groundbreaking yet   I realize that most of these are
    Pro features, and I do still understand why most people aren’t chomping at the bit for the latest and
    greatest — but I’ve been happy with the upgrade so far.

     Glad; but not surprised, that this comment has been made. The R&D has pretty much been done. Apple said as
    much when they introduced the “final form of iPhone” with the X, stopped reporting iPhone sales figures,
    and went in HARD on min-maxing logistics and went all in on the services that come WITH the purchase of
    iPhone & other ecosystem enforcing products.    If you want novelty, samsung sells a $3000 bendy phone
    with midrange performance, lousy cameras that can’t be left near water or dust (and other compromises)

     My Oppo find N5 sparks the excitement that you refer to

     Android users;🤔

     Tbh I think the 14 pro max was a wow phone for me

     13 series was the last time I was excited about any phone release form any company, and that was only
    excitement for 120hz on an iPhone lol

     What model do you think the iphone peaked at?

     Speak for yourself. I love every single CPU and GPU upgrade I make every generation.

     Idk about the computer part. Depends on what you do with a computer, is it for work flow, gaming, editing,
    ai training, or all of that. iPhones and phones in general though? Most people use them as just a phone
    and for networking so I’d say apart from camera improvements and battery life it’s been pretty much
    gimmicks since 2015.

     Have you seen the GPD Win Max 2025? Being an iPhone and Mac user, this machine is the absolute perfection
    for my needs, so much I think I'm gonna sell my Mac soon. It definitely has the WOW effect.

     Agree. And agree with OP. Pretty sad right? You used to get excited about the next iPhone because it WOULD
    have something cool. I think the IPhone X was the last real innovative one. I got the 14 Pro and I like it
    but in terms of big change and wow factor I think IPhone X was the last.  If only Apple could stay as
    innovative. Now they focus on making “slimmest phone/watch” ever. Like I don’t care. I want to spend this
    hard earned money on something that makes a DIFFERENCE.  They seemed to miss this from their motto “think
    differently”.  Now it’s stay the same, slowly iterate.

     I’d say the days of anxiously awaiting a release have been gone since the iPhone 6. I got slightly excited
    for the X but since it’s just been “oh hey another year a new iPhone … ehh it’s not doing much that I
    can’t already do”. I picked up an iPhone 12 for 200$ a couple months back and it’s been the upgrade to my
    X. I like it but I won’t be upgrading to anything else for a very long time

     This thing about launching cell phones every year too. I buy my iPhone every 2 or 3 years because there is
    almost no difference between them

     I really don’t agree with computers but phones yeah sure

     ""...replacing a phone or computer is basically more of an inconvenience than anything else""    Nailed it.
    And I'd say it's both as inconvenient and exciting as getting new tires on your car. Nothing else is
    different and the thing still drives more or less the same.

     Maybe you’re right.  I’m not interested at all in foldable phones. One thing that interest me is the DeX
    (by Samsung I believe). A phone being a computer while connected to a computer screen. But I doubt
    companies would like to develop this, especially Apple. The computers sales would fall dramatically.

     Switching to Pixel 9 from iPhone 13 was the first time in a decade that I felt the ""Wow"" factor from a
    phone.  Phone App  * Call Screening  * Hold for Me  Google Photos & Camera   * Magic Eraser  * Photo
    Unblur  * Best Take * Add Me  Google Search/System  * Circle to Search  System/Pixel Features  * Live
    Translate  * At a Glance  Gemini  * On-Screen Awareness  * Gemini Live (Livestream your camera or screen
    share while talking live to Gemini)



 The iPhone is a properly established product, as is the smart phone more
generally. Right now, there's not a lot to innovate on - they're just iterating.
Not defending Apple or anyone, just saying it's probably an area we'll see
little, big breakthroughs in for the foreseeable without another big shakeup. 
 
     I’ve always considered myself a techie and would be excited to see the next phone.   But now I’m at the
    stage where I’m sticking with my 14 Pro because it’s purple 🤷

     Yea the phones do everything we need.   And I’m happy apple is smart enough to let a winner be a winner,
    unlike new cars which seem to jump on any marketing gimmick.    A bigger battery seems to be the only
    obvious improvement that would be welcomed, then maybe more storage and better camera.  Rest of it is
    fine.  People gotta nit pick pretty deep to find flaws with it, which means it is really capable

     I would like to see a foldable where you won’t notice the fold itself when opened.

     I def agree, Im not sure if it's time for something new or IDK. But I think the iPhone itself is pretty
    much fully developed.  Besides refining what's already there; making it bigger/smaller, better battery,
    camera, screen, theres not much to be done and it's just repackaging the product every year. Given it is a
    great product.

     Agreed. There sorta just… isn’t much to be exciting. We already did the bonkers screen, amazing camera,
    long battery life, tons of storage, insanely powerful processor, face id, where do they go next? Aside
    from just adding on pointless gimmicks like sliding pop out cameras just for the sake of having something
    new to advertise there really isn’t much to do

     It’s funny you say we can’t expect breakthroughs… I saw a leak that shows they’re planning to MAKE THE
    CAMERA BUMP BIGGER! This will totally disrupt the industry if they can pull it off.

     I'd be happy if they just tweaked stuff for the better.  Like a proper app drawer, make modifying your
    home screens way more easy, not dictating so many things that should be customer choice.

     Rabbit? Humane pin? 😜

     That’s what I was thinking when reading seeing the different iPhones they’ve had. Each one had a pretty
    big jump in technology. Seems like we’ve hit a bit of a ceiling with the technology, so there wasn’t much
    of a difference between the XR and 16.

     > Right now, there's not a lot to innovate on  Just because no one has found it doesn’t mean there is
    nothing to innovate on. 

     I evaluate tech for real-world usage, and the iPhone still has not passed accessibility for a large scale.
    iPhone’s court-mandated accessibility mode is truncated, limiting access to nearly everything a working
    professional needs. “Just iterating” ignores foldables, frame-rate boosts, and actual hands-free UX—areas
    Apple lags in.   There’s plenty left to innovate, their customers are complacent and do not complain, or
    when something changes every customer over 65 and under 21 complains. They’ve essentially made it
    impossible to innovate because they have not innovated in a while.

     There are still software issues worth spending resources on. They can, for example, innovate to improve
    their horrible keyboard or implement a universal back gesture.



 Tbh I just look at everyday quality of life improvement I.e. Battery life,
brightness, temps, and other factors before diving into 'features'. Upgrading
from a 14, the 16 has better temps so higher sustained brightness and better
battery. Phones in my humble opinion should improve on their core essentials
before improving on gimmicks. Apple intelligence is meh I mainly use copilot
with my 365 subscription which imo is worth it. 
 


 I'm curious to know how a notch is more useful than Dynamic Island. 
 
     Thank you! I thought I was the only person that scratched their head at that part. That’s pure nonsense
    😂😂😂

     I feel like all the posters nitpicking on their phone upgrades are either trolling or have other issues
    going on in their lives.

     I prefer the notch for one reason, you don’t have to reach as high on the screen to pull down notification
    center with a 14/ 16e

     I hated the notch, the dynamic island was my favourite thing about upgrading.

     I feel the dynamic island is more intrusive to the overall screen than a simple notch.

     The island is useless...Like, it offers nothing to me aside having pretty animations but that's all about
    it. Yeah, there's the convenient of having some ""access"" to certain apps but honestly that's only useful y
    you have a small model.



 Seems like you do not need the newest phone. A 13 mini would be great for you as
well. 
 
     Love my mini.

     Yeah as someone who went from an 11 to a 16 - it felt like the jump it used to be for me. Way lighter,
    better design and feel, much improved camera, insane battery life compared to before, etc.

     I just bought a red one and going to be using my 13 pm as back up.

     Would be great for a year or two, until it doesn't update anymore.   Best to do the opposite like OP is
    doing, buy the newest model (or one year old if you prefer to buy used/refurbished and save some money)
    and keep it for multiple years.



 Last wow effect was the iPhone X. 
 
     The iphone x in the hand feels like a more modern phone then the current iphones



 As someone who went from a 6S to a SE2020. the jump to a 15 felt *nice*.
looking at specs though, I gotta agree with your assessment. idk how going from
an Xr to anything newer has too much of a jump.   I will say, personally i like
the dynamic island, i never much liked the idea of the notch, and find myself
using the island a lot for music control.  but idk how it directly compares to a
notch 
 
     I went to an old 3GS to 5S then a SE2020, but it recently broke (motherboard defect) and I'm undecided
    between the iPhone 14 (because I want a red product) and an iPhone 16 (or 16e), but the prices are very
    expensive and I'm also in doubt about the 14 because it's been out for 3 years already (fear of not
    receiving update) I usually keep an iphone for 4\~5 years mostly (or more).



 People‘s expectations are just crazy.. of course a square screen with speakers
will be pretty much perfected after 16 years of top notch engineering work going
into it. 
 
     > top notch  Hehe. Get it?

     I think people are expecting more for the money. Outside of the US iPhones have gotten considerably more
    expensive and you are starting to see people not being happy with the price to value ratio. 



 Why are people buying a new iPhone for “wow effect?” Apple won’t innovate your
phone to be wow. Grab an android. Apple wants everything better for the internal
components rather than the layout of the phone. I had 11 pro max since 2019. I’m
blown away by my 16 pro max. Phone hella fast and hella smooth. Battery life is
fucking amazing. 95% of the layout , apps and icons are the same as my 11 pro
max. But I already knew that BEFORE getting the 16 pro max. I purchased the 16
for satellite text , Genmoji and more important the BATTERY LIFE. 
 


 I don’t know if you were just more impressed by stuff that was less impressive,
or you’re just expecting too much now.   I don’t know that I understand how
incorporating the dynamic island with features is more useless than the notch
that literally did nothing in the ui and was just there housing components… but
sure.   It’s a phone. You don’t need to think about it too much.

Why does my child’s phone say it’s going to be removed?,"Why does my child’s phone say it’s going to be removed?

I have a troubled teen who is currently on lock down for his choices in life. He
has his phone but everything is restricted except for contact with specific
family members, counselors, and a couple of other important people.   This
morning I got a notification that a new apple product was connecting to my WiFi.
There were 2 log ins for iPhone 11’s which were disconnected within the past 20
minutes.   I’m not getting anything for data on screen time restrictions and I
found that his iPhone says it’s going to be removed from my family account next
month.  Can anyone tell me what is going on here? Asking him is pointless and
I’m honestly not up for fighting with him for the phone.

 He was somehow able to deactivate his child apple ID + parental controls 
 
     Yeah. I just confirmed that. He has a new Apple ID on his phone but some how it is still locked down and
    he can’t access most of it.

     [removed]

     Let him keep those off. He’s a human. Too often, parental controls are meant to be a way to not teach
    their kids, allowing tech to do it instead.

     You’re such an opp

     Fed👀

     Why would you snitch on him



 He probably DFU wiped it and set up a new Apple ID. 
 
     If he knows the password to the Apple ID then yes this probably happened

     Can he do this without a Mac computer? Only computer he has access to is his schools chrome book



 I’m sure this is no help at all, but I was the exact same way as a teen and into
my 20’s. I gave my parents absolute hell and they paid for legal fees and all
kinds of shit for me. I grew up, I’m 30 now and just bought a house with the
love of my life. I apologize to my mom frequently for the crap that I put her
through. Dad passed so I can only live in a way that would make him proud if he
was still here. I hope your teen has a moment of awakening as I did. I’m still a
little shit but not in any ways that would ever cause harm or trouble. lol 
 
     Damn I’m happy to hear that you turned out a better person, also love that you still apologize to your mom
    for the things you did, that’s super sweet

     He’d for sure be proud

     howd u fix urself if u dont mind me askin?

     Ok



 I have read all comments. I know you are not answering back. Just wanted to show
my support in these hardtimes for you. Hope it gets better. 
 


 At this point, get him a flip phone. It’s what my mom did for my sister when she
wasn’t doing great, and my mom still holds onto it in case she decides not to
behave well again 
 
     My dad did this with my brother as well. Bought him a £20 Alcatel when he was being a shit and I remember
    his iPhone being confiscated and replaced with it at least twice. Funniest shit.

     repeating the same punishment, especially when its taking away devices, is counterproductive and will make
    teenagers more spiteful, js. they’re gonna find a way to use the internet anyways.

     Good advice from Father

     Arlecchino jumpscare.

     Least obvious arlecchino fan

     I got a old phone, but found out my 3ds had unlimited internet acces. After they figured it out, the wifi
    got disabled at certain times. So I got the neighbors wifi

     Bingo. Flip phones are a great compromise; particularly in this case, when the parent will no longer be
    providing access to a data plan. Flip phones still give you the ability to text and call. A laptop or
    tablet for home can provide internet access for home or school then.   Looks like a number of good, solid
    reasons for limiting smart phone use were provided by OP. Putting limits isn’t always “bad”. Kids and
    teens do not have the brain development needed to make certain decisions about safety, and guidance is
    sometimes needed to help them do so.

     I did this to my daughter several times while she was in high school. Make stupid decisions, win stupid
    prizes.



 I appreciate all the comments. Since I have gotten the original information I
was looking for I am going to stop replying to comments at this point. I
understand that there are a vast number of options on why my child did this. I
am not in the space to sit and defend my actions or debate about my parenting
choices. 
 
     Just wanted to wish you and your family the best of luck, and I hope you're getting support for yourself
    as well. This can be emotionally exhausting, so try to remember to take care of yourself too, and carve
    out time to spend focused on your younger child. A troubled teen can end up sucking up all the energy in a
    household, and that's not fair to you or anyone else.

     I’m sorry people were more interested in invading your personal life than they were trying to help you   I
    wish the best for you and your family :)

     You’re doing great, mom/dad. My kids are young, but I’m already dreading teenage years. You’re working
    hard with you were dealt, and through all your comments I hear love. Don’t let internet strangers get you
    down. You’re doing the best you can.

     I have nothing helpful to add on your OP.  But, I wanted to send you love and light right now.  I’m so
    sorry you’re going through all of this.

     Wishing you well

     Thank you for not giving up on him.  He sounds  a lot like my brother, who now has a beautiful family and
    has made a career doing this ethically and legally

     You’re a good parent that knows what’s best for their child. It’s hard on the internet because everyone
    thinks they know how to be a parent better than other people and it’s exhausting. Keep your head up, and
    don’t give up. ❤️

     take the whole phone away then



 You need your lock down your network.  Configure it to only allow specific MAC
addresses.  Then, he can’t add an additional device.  If his new phone has
cellular, then he can still bypass your restrictions. 
 
     would not work in this case. the kid just reset the phone and made a new apple id.  the MAC adress is
    still the same as it's hardware bound.   so all that would help is changing the wifi password to something
    complex.  like AbC123#$%. make sure to use capitals and special characters and mix and match.  because if
    he's smart to figure out how to reset the phone  with DFU to bypass restrictions. then he's also smart
    enough to google and  run a simple wifi password cracking utility (i would know because i was the exact
    same but at 13 years old)

     I have no clue how to do any of that. I grew up with computers but when I was learning about them they
    were still using DOS and the original windows.    I did change the password on my network and paused the
    connection to all of his devices that were listed.

     There are ways around that. That’s what my mom did for our network when I was a teenager. I just learned
    how to spoof my MAC address, and copied down the one from her iPad when she wasn’t looking

     MAC address authentication is very poor practise in corporate IT. I use it only for very-low-stakes
    things, such as preventing users from accidentally connecting from a network with limited LAN access.   It
    is really easy to spoof MAC addresses. I would say that in this situation I recommend using a SSO system
    for wifi access. I have this set up at my home, although this is rather overkill and complex for such a
    situation.

     That's pain in the ass if you buy anything new for a house that uses internet



 Take the phone away and get him a dumb phone for texting/calls.   It seems he is
trying to get around the restrictions. 
 
     Dude its a fucking child of course just let him do him



 I don’t know if this will get buried or not but I’m going to explain a few
things here.  1: I cannot legally take the phone away from him. It belongs to
him. I do pay for the service but I cannot cut that off either. I am not allowed
to cut off his contact with a list of specific people.  2: A flip phone will not
work in this situation. He won’t carry one and I use his phone location to track
him. I don’t push this because I’d rather have the location date for his safety
than for him to go awol with no phone.  3: I asked a simple question about the
screenshot provided. I know nothing about iPhones since I am new to them  4: The
parenting advice is really unnecessary. I have chosen to remain vague on a
variety of things to protect the children and myself.  The people that need to
know what is happening in my kid’s life have been informed. I am not a perfect
parent and I am doing the absolves that I can with the situation at hand. 
 
     Just a couple follow ups:   1) Does your son require internet access to contact that list of people. If he
    does not need internet, call 611 from his phone (or your phone if you share a provider) and ask them to
    block data. You may need to escalate to a supervisor/retention, but this is something they should be able
    to do for you.  2) If you do number 1 above, Find My iPhone still works with internet/cellular disabled,
    as long as nearby iPhones are connected.   If you own a business (you need a DUNS number) enroll in [apple
    business manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/sign-up-axm402206497/web), and
    [supervise his iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-
    us/102291#:~:text=If%20you're%20an%20administrator,the%20devices%20that%20they%20own) . This will allow
    you to use software like [JAMF Now](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/) to manage his device. You can
    use JAMF without supervision, however without supervision the software can be removed. With this you also
    get the benefit of remote management lock, which is much harder to remove then Activation lock. You can
    also have both activation and remote management lock.  There is software that you can install on both your
    router his iPhone to manage internet access when connected to Wi-Fi. I use
    [https://nextdns.io/](https://nextdns.io/) to manage my parent's devices (mainly for the ad-block
    functionality). Other software that is available is [https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-
    security/](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) . A couple important limitations: No filter is
    perfect, and network/DNS based filtering (like I recommended) is more vulnerable to bypass. I am only
    recommending it cause it sounds like your son would be savvy enough to get around any on-device
    restrictions. Also, If you only install it on your son's iPhone (and it is un-supervised) he can remove
    the app/configuration pretty easily. The app does support having different settings for different devices,
    and can easily be installed on your router, so I would set the most restrictive settings possible on your
    there, and then creating less restrictive profiles for your devices. This way you have restricted internet
    access to everything except on your devices.

     Bro… what is going on? I’m sorry for whatever is happening, but I wish you the best. I can’t give you any
    parental advice, however I can inform you that you can go to your routers settings and block any ip you
    want from being accessed within your network (if you didn’t know this already)  Edit: I thought the
    investigations were for the 6 year old, I was so confused. You’re right, blocking websites won’t do
    anything, neither will a therapist (unless he goes with his own will). I think you should ask for advice
    from someone who specialises in that stuff, and try to help him your self.

     How bout giving him an apple watch with sim. And a flip phone

     What do you mean “legally belongs to him”?  And why can you not cut off certain services, or block certain
    numbers and websites?   Have there been a bunch of new laws passed recently? You are the account owner.
    Your children are minors. You are their legal guardian. I am genuinely curious about any new law passed
    that might prevent you from having control over their devices

     Just a bit of reassurance:  #You’re doing fine.   Keep up the care & dedication for your family. ✌🏼

     Bro what?  1. Yes, you absolutely can, or you stop paying for service.   2. That shouldn’t matter, because
    he shouldn’t be able to *leave the house*.  No wonder this kid is fucked, you refuse to parent him 

     If you’re in America and he’s a minor you can legally take the phone whether it’s his or not. Children
    basically have no rights. Doesn’t matter if he paid for it, if it’s in his name, nothing. You can take it



 might need a router that has built in child limitation tools. most new ones have
them built in.

Well... crap.,"Well... crap.

Long time iphone user since 2015 (6, 6s+, 11, 15) and have never had a phone
break in any way. Currently using a 15 with Verizon and I'm also a LEO. A week
ago I ended up fighting a suspect and we both fell to the ground, on the same
left side where my phone was in my cargo pocket. Screen is fine and didn't think
anything happened to it. Today I took the case off to clean the phone... and
sure enough my phone is actually bent. Screen and back glass intact and
everything seems to be working just fine.  Unfortunately I didn't get the
Verizon phone insurance and don't have Applecare other than the 1 year limited
warranty. I don't have access to a replacement chassis or the tech know-how to
fix it. Dunno if I should just roll with it or see if Apple can fix it for a fee
without me being screwed since this is on a monthly payment upgrade from my 11.

 Just pretend you have a curved display when watching videos horizontally 
 
     With the small display and viewing distance he could be getting a better curved experience vertically.

     It's not a bug. It's a feature.

     Damn apples stealing from Samsung again

     💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣

     💀🗿

     I bet you still think insurance is scam right? 😜

     On its way to becoming Apple's first folding phone!



 I dont get how your sign relates to this… but hey, im a taurus and I like long
walks on the beach 
 
     Not gonna lie, my first thought was low earth orbit 🤣

     Unrelated. But gave me a chuckle after a long day at work. Thank you!

     I see what you mean, a LEO is law enforcement officer. Everything is an acronym in this job so I always
    just use LEO.

     Typical Taurus.

     ACAB - All Capricorns Are Bastards

     first i was like??? mb its some internal usa stuff, then i read that and lold so much

     Thanks for the laugh 😂

     That was funny as fuck! I busted up laughing and woke my sleepy wife up. So, thanks for that lol

     I laughed at this way too much.

     I needed that laugh today, thanks 😂

     Made my day🤣

     Yah me too, anyway I'm Aquarius and I like to play games

     Bruh, I was thinking about the exact same joke but figured most people here would know exactly what LEO
    (as opposed to the uncapitalized version) would mean so I didn’t expect anyone to think of the same joke.
    Glad I’m not the only one with this type of thinking!

     I’m a Leo as well and it happened to my phone. I didn’t not fall and didn’t even have a phone. Just one
    day i saw there was a phone and it was bent. I’m typing from it right now. Very grateful for being a Leo.
    Edit: Also let me know if someone is missing a bent iPhone.

     typical taurus

     Il parle de son métier … et non pas de son signe astrologique .

     As an Aquarius, when my phone becomes curved I just go with the flow

     Just a dumb Cancer here looking for a good laughcry

     LEO: Law Enforcement Officer Not a Leo ♌️😂

     Bravo!

     lol. LEO - law enforcement officer



 You see those Apple users from Hammerfell? 
 
     They got curved phones. Curved. Phones!

     damn bro. here have my upvote.



 Can you get it replaced through work? “My personal property was damaged in the
line of duty / due to job-related events” or something. 
 
     I'll have to ask my sergeant about that. Didn't think about that. I'm currently on workers comp for a knee
    injury during that same incident.

     Highly doubt that. I’m in LE also and I talked to one of our troopers in the area and NOTHING personal is
    covered. Only what’s issued to you is.



 I had a cousin who was a cop but they actually had a second cheap android phone
they used when they were at work. They kept their really good and expensive
phone at home and just used it when they were off duty. They probably broke
three of the spare phones over the course of several years. But that kind of a
job you really do need Applecare+ 
 
     Yeah that's weird, id rather have ac+ than a cheap work phone. Unless there's other reasons...🫣

     Applecare+ for sure but just need to keep their personal phone in the car as there no reason to carry it
    around.

     > they actually had a second cheap android phone they used when they were at work.  My boy had the burner
    on him :)



 Turn it the opposite way and fall on it again. 
 
     Need the suspect again though



 I would say roll with it, maybe get a case that will camouflage it enough for
you to forget it.  It’s like a broken nose, it has character. 
 
     I accidentally ran an iPhone 6 over w a dirt bike and it was bent worse than this. That was yearrrs ago
    and I JUST got a new phone. It worked fine and I actually liked how it fit in my hand haha

     lold alot! nice one take



 Check Apple first otherwise use it till it doesn’t work. Not worth paying for a
new phone if it works totally fine. Bend might be annoying but it’s worth not
paying another grand 
 
     Yea that's what I'm thinking. I wish I had an actual apple store near me, closest one is about an hour
    away. Might make the drive and see what they can do. I read somewhere that they can do chassis
    replacements but dunno how true that is.



 What kind of phone case was it in?? 
 
     OtterBox symmetry. I guess from now on I'm using more durable cases.



 If everything is working fine then just keep it and use it till your next phone
upgrade. 
 
     Nah fam, if the battery is bent it has way higher risk of thermal run off.

 Fark man what are you doing 7 hrs straight on your phone and at this time lol 
 
     Testing the battery basically😭😂 I always use phones a ton when I first get them to test the battery life,
    so I’ve been playing games, watching YouTube, etc. Send help lmao



 I don’t even get 4 hours on my XR 
 
     I’ve been there. the last iPhone I used before this one was an iPhone 5c shortly after they launched. I
    was a kid so I was happy with it it first, but by the time I upgraded I was getting older starting to
    notice my 2.5-3.5 hr sot lol

     Because Johnny Ive decided to provide thin phone, the next gen 11 get 33% more



 [removed] 
 
     This is extra though

     Agreed. Have the normal 13 Pro since Sep 21 and it was really good for about a year. But since months now
    I have to recharge my phone over the day because otherwise I would run out. pretty annoying



 I haven’t been getting such a nice battery life. It’s good but sometimes I have
to do a little top up before the end of the day. 
 


 I’ve been using it all day and I’m still at 88% battery 
 
     Nice man, what IOS version are you on?



 Enjoy it while it lasts, my 13pm used to be a battery monster, now it’s just
good. 
 


 All I know is I never have a problem with my battery. I don’t think there’s been
a time when I’ve run out and not been able to plug-in or have to sit next to a
wall to use my phone. Very happy with the 14 promax. 
 


 bruh ive had a 14 pro max for two weeks and all of a sudden starting today (I
unplugged it at 12 pm btw) battery's draining faster than usual (10 hours after
unplugging its at 49%) 
 
     Did you install any new apps, did your phone update, or was there any other known change that occurred
    just before the drain started?

     Same



 i still feel like the 13 pro max is better and i've got aod turned off as i'd
rather have the extra 10% battery it drains 
 
     I’ve seen conflicting results about this. Some tests show them neck and neck, while others I’ve seen show
    a clearer lead for the 14. I just got my 13 Pro Max recently and the battery has been phenomenal for me.
    Better than anything I’ve ever had before.

     There are more factors than just battery life…

"
iPhone 14 doesn’t have Apple intelligence features but under screen time it’s there,"iPhone 14 doesn’t have Apple intelligence features but under screen time it’s there

 I just noticed this. Not sure if this has been asked.   Apple intelligence is
not supported by iPhone 14 and under settings there is no option for Apple
intelligence. But under screen time, there is one.   Any ideas why?

 It’s because screen time syncs across devices, so if you (or your child) have
another iPhone or iPad that supports it, you can access this setting to set the
rule. 
 
     Makes sense. Thank you



 Screen time covers all devices, it’s making the assumption the person could
potentially have access to other devices with Apple Intelligence. 
 
     [deleted]



 It doesn’t really make sense for them to ship a special OS without these
features listed. Much easier just to disable them on the phones that don’t
support it. 
 
     They disable menu options based on hardware all the time.

     It’s there but just disabled.   It’s just someone has missed off a feature flag for this view.

     I mean it can be there and to be disabled as a visible element in user interface, it’s the same principle
    because disabling the toggle still requires a flag in OS specific to the devices without Apple
    Intelligence. It’s Apple, not a livingroom startup

 I just seen reduce interruption on my focus modes and got excited Ggs 
 


 I'm not tech savvy by any means, but I don't understand why my 14 Pro Max, a
phone lauded to be a space age tech not even 3 years ago, can't handle new
features on current releases. I don't care if it runs slower when using AI, but
I spent $1,000 made of durable materials, right? Shouldn't the longevity of it
being a *technologically* relevant phone be good as well? 
 
     >I’m not tech savvy by any means  You don’t understand why a device that was released two years before new
    tech (that doesn’t even work fully on their current top of the line devices yet) was announced doesn’t
    support those new features?



 That's because it's software. It's all fucking software. They could upgrade the
ability of the device quite easily. Actually they just choose not to because
they wouldn't make money. It's that simple. ""Fuck you You're a stupid customer.""
Is their attitude essentially. I stopped buying Apple products a long time ago
because of shit like this. Most other companies aren't better but they're not
that bad  Buncha apple suckers here dam lol 
 
     Just wanted to put this out there: When SparserRestore, an exploit allowing editing system files your not
    supposed to be able to, came out, people used it to enable Apple Intelligence on unsupported models. It
    did not run very good at all. Now of course Apple would’ve done more optimizations if they had officially
    supported these devices, but Apple tries to never release something to a device that does not have a good
    user experience for that device.

     It literally isn’t just software though?   They’ve literally bumped up the RAM from 8gb to 16gb base for
    all their laptops because the hardware wasn’t enough for it?   Where do people learn this nonsense from
    lol.  Their “privacy” focus angle means they need to do a lot of the processing on device which is hard to
    do on older chips/less ram etc.



 They want you to upgrade. New features are behind a paywall. 
 
     No. Apple intelligence priorities on device computation and only reaches out to servers for more complex
    tasks (larger models) unlike google or Microsoft’s ai.   Which is how it should be.   The iPhone 14 simply
    doesn’t have the hardware required to run these calculations.



 The cynic in me says it’s there to remind you that you have features you’re
missing out on and to encourage you to upgrade.

"UPDATE: In less than 24 hours, /r/iPhone will be going private indefinitely.","UPDATE: In less than 24 hours, /r/iPhone will be going private indefinitely.

***Update to our post from a couple hours ago announcing our immediate shut down
of posting.***  Hi everyone,  We apologise for the back and forth messaging
here, but we just wanted to update our community on our intentions to make
/r/iPhone **private** (from restricted) in the next 24 hours. This follows on
from [our most recent announcement made a couple hours ago](https://www.reddit.c
om/r/iphone/comments/145pzrs/riphone_has_shut_down_posting_in_protest_against/)
where we took the subreddit restricted (meaning, the subreddit would still be
visible but no new posts would come through). Please read that post too, for the
full context on the situation.  This was not an easy decision to make, given a
variety of factors, but it's one we feel comfortable making. Anything that was
posted before the restricted mode came into effect earlier today will
essentially be the final front page of our community before we privatise the
subreddit entirely. In the (somewhat unlikely) scenario that Reddit's leadership
has a change of direction that sees the reversal the recent API policy change,
we will reopen the subreddit, but until this happens, /r/iPhone will be
unavailable for use in any capacity whatsoever. Many other subreddits are doing
the same, and we support them for taking a stand.  **FAQ:**  **Q: What does
making** /r/iPhone **private mean, in this case?**  >A: Taking /r/iPhone private
means that no-one, except moderators and approved submitters, can see the
subreddit's front page. When attempting to access the subreddit, you will be met
with a blank screen stating ""r/iPhone has been set to private by its subreddit
moderators.""   **Q: What does indefinite mean in this case?**  >A: Originally,
the protest was planned to be 48 hours. However, after a shambolic AMA held by
Reddit's CEO, it has become clear to us that Reddit doesn't intend to act in
good faith. When the CEO is willing to lie and spread libellous claims about
another third-party developer, and then try *double down* by vilifying them,
again, in an AMA, despite being proven as a liar by the developer through audio
recordings, that's when we knew what we were up against. Therefore, the
subreddit will be privatised until such time as a reasonable resolution is
proposed.   **Q: Won't Reddit just remove you as moderators and force open the
subreddit?**  >A: This is very possible. Reddit has made it clear on various
occasions that they will do what they need to do in order to keep the site
running. We, as mods, are prepared for this outcome. None of us want to moderate
for a site that continues to gaslight its user-base, disrespect third-party
developers and moderators, or do *volunteer* work for a site run by a CEO who
spreads outright lies and libellous claims against those who helped build it
into the front page of the internet.  **Q: Where else can I go to discuss
iPhone's and/or iOS?**  >Feel free to [join our affiliated Discord
server](https://discord.gg/iphone). This server is supported by, and run by,
members of the subreddit mod team.  Lastly, thank you. Whatever happens to us
moderators, we want to thank you for helping make /r/iPhone the place it is
today. We have thoroughly enjoyed watching this community grow, and we
understand it wouldn't be anywhere near where it is today without you, the
users. We haven't always got stuff right, but we hope you understand we've
always wanted what's best for the community. Hopefully we'll be back together
soon, but the ball is in Reddit's court. What happens next is down to them and
them alone. Let's just hope they do the right thing, and come to us with a
proper resolution.  See you soon, hopefully.  /r/iPhone Mod Team.

 Farewell, folks.   *Posted via Apollo for Reddit* 
 
     Replying to top comment to encourage people to rate and review Apollo and other 3rd party apps on the iOS
    & Google Play stores.   These apps deserve to go out on the highest note they possibly can, as they have
    continually focused on improving the user experience. And by “user”, I mean the actual users rather than
    just the advertisers.   If you feel so inclined, you should also share your constructive criticism of the
    1st party Reddit client on the iOS and Google Play stores. Honest feedback will be harder for Reddit to
    wave away and have removed by Apple, should their aggregate score start to turn.   Some store links for

    it’s gone for good 💌  Edit: Spez can eat my ass.

     I appreciate a good cup of coffee.

     Lol see you in a few days. No one is quitting Reddit. People are just full of shit.

     Reddit is a user-aggregated and mod-operated ecosystem. As far as I know none of the mods get paid and
    users contribute a wealth of information (and some not so much).   Just like third-party apps have been
    using the API free of charge, they have been using mods and contributors for free.  So to balance the
    world out I would suggest, if no compromise that is fair to all comes, take each account, delete your
    information from threads and comments, and delete the account - if you feel strongly about it.   If you
    don’t really care, then do you, respect that as well.

     Apollo is going out of business the end of this month anyway. This going for private and dark thing really
    showed Reddit.

     Apollo sucks

     Same bruh this is sad



 This really feels like high school government/ student body government trying to
take on the school district. It's fun to participate in but I don't think it's
going to do shit. 
 
     The difference in your analogy is that the school district does not NEED the student government. It's
    mostly to placate the masses.  Reddit \*needs\* content. If the content creators (and by that I mean
    people who create posts and comment on threads... like you and me) leave, if the content leaves (private
    subs) and the mods leave... There is nothing left.  Reddit sells DAU (Daily Active Users) to advertisers
    and investors. If there is no content, there are no users... there is no DAU. They are dead in the water.
    Reddit actually needs \*us\* more than we need it. There will be another reddit replacement that shows up
    shortly, just as reddit was the replacement to Digg.

     Yeah. It won’t matter. This sub will go dark and another one will take its place. This is all
    performative.

     If thousands of subreddits go dark indefinitely it will work.  Reddit can't replace mods for thousands of
    subreddits.

     Exactly. All these little reddit revolutionaries got another thing coming if they think Reddit®️ gives a
    shit about them. We're all free users. They don't care. But hey it makes these people feel good about
    themselves.

     Unlike high school, there's no requirement we all be here. We can take on reddit in the same way people
    took on digg. By leaving. That's what I'll be doing when the third party apps shut down.

     It really is just incredibly silly.

     Reddit will go on but it will shed users and viable alternatives will rise up in the meantime. Lemmy for
    example literally gained thousands of users over night after the issues with the api became apparent.
    Reddit has had a tight grasp over the forum/messageboard/community discussion space and after all these
    years they finally squeezed hard enough for users to start slipping through their fingers.  Will it die?
    Probably not. Will the alternatives become as big as reddit? Oh absolutely not. But thats not a bad thing
    either for the web to decentralize a little and for there to once again be smaller and medium sized
    communities not all under one corporate umbrella.

     Agreed. These protests will do *nothing*.

     I don't think anything is going to change Reddits mind at this point, but I fully support every subreddit
    going dark in protest.

     Tech nerds thinking they can change corporate decisions.

     It's just going to make this sub more it an echo chamber than it already is, and it's already really bad.

     Agreed. And it’s all just because people can’t use an app on the phone anymore. Apple and Google remove
    apps all the time and you don’t see this kind of child like behavior. It’s pretty funny actually.

     You're right. Reddit has all the content already and the lock in.

     It’ll literally do nothing.



 Unfortunate it’s having to go this way, but as the post says, the ball is in
Reddit’s court.   -       Posted from Apollo 
 
     Something tells me they’re going to push forward with their plan.   Reddit has gone full corporate now and
    we’re not their main concern.   Hopefully the user number crater over the coming months so that precious
    IPO goes kaput.   -       Apollo for Reddit

     Lol imagine protesting something by gatekeeping a sub… which is essentially what you’re angry at Reddit
    for. Y’all are really just 10yr old kids aren’t you?

     You and I, regular people are the product. Without us this platform is worthless. I personally will be
    going dark to protest the way Reddit is handling third parties. I don’t foresee Reddit changing paths
    which is their propagative. It’s also my option to leave this platform which I will likely do on June 30.
    If you’re going to delete your account then use something like https://redact.dev/ to wipe your history.

     I think Reddit will make nothing. So farewell all!

     Thank you so much. I have enjoyed this community for such a long time and you have my full support in this
    move

     The vast majority of us use the official Reddit app.  What a selfish decision to scrub information. Hoping
    Reddit removes these type of mods indefinitely. People like this are clearly not in a healthy state of
    mind.

     Give them hell! Fuck u/spez  *Posted via Infinity for Reddit*



 This is EXACTLY how unchecked corporate type greed absolutely DESTROYS the user
(aka customer) experience   It is OK to be profitable. It is even the very
foundation of all business models. Yet, the product and the user experience *is
the pathway to profit*  As an iPhone user and longtime Apple person AND Reddit
paid subscriber; this isn’t a good look for the business when a sub I check into
on a daily basis is just GONE from my catalogue of choices.   The Mods are doing
the right thing and I fully support this.   The executive team is what is
destroying the user experience and making some people rethink subscription (aka
paying customers will leave the site) 
 
     A certain other sub tried to warn us that Reddit was asshoe and got ejected from the platform. Who
    would’ve thunk this is where Reddit was going. /s

     The least Reddit can do this whole time is to make their app better and more forgiving. However, they
    somehow even managed to fail this part.

     if it's free,  you aren't the customer.  you are the product.

     It’s the mods who are yanking the rug out from beneath themselves and all others- by choice.  Talk about
    cutting off your nose to spite your face

     Did you intend to name your Reddit account after the defunct retail chain of the same name:

     Question. What’s to stop someone else just making another iPhone sub?

     You guys suck.

     Why Christian and others doesn’t start a new social network? They have the knowhow for a successful app,
    so that’s a start at least.

 > A: Originally, the protest was planned to be 48 hours. However, after a
shambolic AMA held by Reddit's CEO, it has become clear to us that Reddit
doesn't intend to act in good faith. When the CEO is willing to lie and spread
libellous claims about another third-party developer, and then try double down
by vilifying them, again, in an AMA,  Suggest adding quote marks around ""AMA""
since spez made the mistake of copy/paste the ""A:"" portion from pre-approved
responses by his legal team. It wasn't an AMA. It was poorly run and coordinated
PR.  > Q: Won't Reddit just remove you as moderators and force open the
subreddit?  > A: This is very possible.  Unfortunately, this is exactly what
they will do. They did this to workreform, which is a smaller subreddit. And the
right-wing mods of the AppleCard subreddit have been chomping at the bit to take
over any of the larger Apple subs. If they take this sub over, I'm gone. 
 


 Strip all your CSS and wiki, copy it to a safe place. If they force new mods to
take over, they better start from scratch.

     I honestly would love it if the second all the subs went dark the mods were all removed and the subs
    reopened, it would be hilarious just thinking of the mod meltdowns knowing that all they did was give up
    their control of the subs.   The mods don’t seem to care or realise that most of the people using their
    subs are NOT in favour of this blackout. We don’t care, we just want to use Reddit on the official app and
    website like 95% of us do.

120Hz is insane,"120Hz is insane

I recently upgraded to the 16 Pro from my 12 Pro. I've never actually seen a
120Hz screen in my life and I'm 27 😭 I always thought 60Hz was perfectly smooth
and never felt like I needed anything more until I used the new phone, I noticed
the difference immediately, and despite only using it for a week so far I still
can't get over the ""smoothness"" of the screen every time I pick it up. For the
first few days using it was actually sensory overload because I've never taken
in motion that smooth or thought I could comprehend any motion that smooth. When
my eyes got used to the 120Hz I went back to 60 it genuinely felt choppy. I
completely understand why some people consider it a dealbreaker or exclusively
want to use 120Hz

 Working on my 165hz display for 8hrs then going to a normal 60hz tv after work
is always noticeable. Feels like the tv is stuttering. 
 
     How would a 165hz TV make the vast majority of things you can watch look any smoother on your TV?

     counterpoint I use my pc with a 165hz monitor and I don't really notice when I switch to my 60hz phone

     same. i work on my 144hz monitor (lg gk650) in my studio, and my iphone/tv (13 pro max, lg b8) are both
    120hz, but my laptop, ipad, and switch (13"" m1 macbook pro, ipad 10), are all 60hz and it gives me motion
    sickness sometimes

     It’s really hard for me to go back to lower refresh rates these days for this reason. The difference is
    jarring.

     That's why I watch the TV on my PC.

     Just get an OLED with 144Hz, it’s a game changer

     Is it why my eyes hurt when I watch TV a few times a month after using all the time a 120hz 15 Pro max?

     I have a s24 ultra and I pulled out my iphone 12 pro out after many years and the 60hz was so bad

     Really? Working with a 165Hz laptop & a 60Hz monitor, never noticed any difference...

     Oh Jesus I can't believe people have 60hz TVs anymore. Once I upgraded my monitor to 120hz for gaming I
    made sure everything in my life was that or higher. It's very noticeable.

     Huh, dunn make sense to me

     High frame rates above 60fps are terrible for content consumption. Makes it look fake.



 This thread shows that visual perception varies across individuals: from those
who cannot tell the difference to those for whom it is so obvious that they
cannot go back to 60 after experiencing 120. I wonder if anyone would see any
difference at 240. 
 
     I can tell the difference between 165 and 120, it’s so marginal that they have to be side to side for me
    to notice. I turned low power mode on with my 16 pro, I thought I dropped the screen to 30hz but it was
    actually 60 lmao.

     I am sure people would. Although that type of refresh pretty much just for gaming, but 240+hz monitors
    exist for a reason, people can tell. Doubt we see that on a phone anytime soon though haha

     When I upgraded from my 165hz to my 240hz monitor a few years ago I was able to notice the bump in refresh
    rate but it’s not as obvious as going from 60hz to 120/165hz. It’s very noticeable if you look at your
    mouse trail but in normal scrolling and gaming it’s subtle but still noticeable.

     Audio is like this as well. Some people hear a lot more than others, and the other people think it’s
    complete BS

     At least on my monitor at home 120 vs 240 is quite noticeable

     People with corrective vision (contacts/glasses) tend to notice it substantially more than people without.
    20/20 vision or better and you likely see minimal if any change.  Coke bottle glasses and it is certainly
    life changing.  Lots of theories as to why this is, but don’t think there’s any hard data.

     noticeable difference between 120 and 240 when playing video games

     240 is when it’s just diminishing returns for me. Upgraded from 240hz to 360hz monitor and I barely notice
    it being smoother. Emphasis on barely. Don’t think I’ll upgrade to > 480hz or whatever even though it’s
    enticing.  60 to 120 is the biggest difference.

     As a pc gamer who enjoys 240. You definitely can. It’s incredible and there’s even higher refresh rates
    but the monitors cost 1k easily. Not worth that price but eventually it will be the norm.

     Yeah I would love to be able to do more testing on this to see how much of it is confirmation bias and
    placebo. I remember being so excited to try 120 for the first time. I started with a tablet in 2021 and
    then a phone and both times i was like ""really that's all it is?"".    I wouldn't go so far as to say I
    don't notice it at all... But not much. In fact even if I'm using 120 I use two phones I will routinely
    switch back to one with 60 on the same day and it feels incredibly fluid to me.    All of that said I
    still think it's ridiculous that Apple is selling $800 phones without the option of 120. It's not a big
    deal to me but it's a big deal to enough people and it's not some huge expense.



 I’m on a 16pro. And I love it…and it is smoother, but besides smoother scrolling
I still haven’t seen the killer app that really utilises the 120hz.   In all
fairness I don’t play games on my phone. But going from a 60hz monitor to 144hz
in call of duty was life changing. And I haven’t had that feeling with the 16
pro. Maybe I need to install some games. 
 
     Simple scrolling utilises 120hz refresh rate.

     This is the reality of 120hz on smart phones (at least iphones, I haven't used a 60 hz android in probably
    a decade) Everyone in this sub and the internet has been acting like 120hz on your phone is life changing
    when in reality it's mildly smoother scrolling and animations. I regularly switch between my 15 Pro and an
    11,  on your PC, sure I have a 240hz monitor and its absolutely noticeable and I would argue using 60hz
    feels very unusable, but my phone????

     Try Wreckfest. It supports 120hz and it's a great game. Doesn't hurt it is on sale right now :)

     If you like RTS games, check out Northgard 👍 best mobile RTS. I just went from an old iPhone 11 to the 16
    pro and am absolutely loving how smooth it feels not only playing this game but also just general use. I
    sometimes go back on my 11 for different things and it feels extremely choppy.

     How much storage do you have and is it enough? I‘m thinking of buying the 16 pro

     Cod mobile and Warzone are basically just cod on your phone, with controller not mouse and keyboard if
    that’s your thing though, but the games are peak. Best mobile version of console/pc games so far.

     The 16 Pro Max Screen feels less smooth than the 13 Pro Max i just upgraded from

     i played codm on my 13 pro max (i used to play it sometimes on my xiaomi so tried it on my iphone to see
    what kind of improvement i got) and omg it was so smooth. not one frame drop

     What monitor do you use for gaming?

     What killer app are you looking for? Literally day to day use with 120hz is already a huge jump. Even
    scrolling reddit with 120hz is amazing

     > But going from a 60hz monitor to 144hz in call of duty was life changing  My life has completely
    changed. I used to sit down and play call of duty for hours, now I also play it for hours. See how my life
    has changed??!?!?!

     Killer app: Apple News  Go in accessibility in settings, click on motion, and then limit frame rate at the
    bottom. This locks the screen to 60hz. Then scroll in the news app and stare at a word as it scrolls.
    That’s where the 120hz shines  Where the display most shines is its energy efficiency in viewing video
    content.   Movies display at 24 FPS. Much less energy used at 24hz than at 60hz.

     It called instagram

     Yeah I felt incredibly underwhelmed when I finally got 120 after hearing everyone tell me how I was going
    to change my life. To me it's barely noticeable.

     That’s not the point though. I don’t like games on mobile either and that’s why I believe more apps need
    to adopt it than games.

     I went from 15 Pro Max to 16 Pro Max and noticed nothing different. Should I be noticing something? Well
    apart from the fact that the 16PM  is a bigger phone.



 What i know is once you try 120hz screen you never want back to 60hz fr. 
 
     On the recent Digital Foundry direct, John Linneman said he’d been testing a 480hz PC display, and after
    playing a bunch of games on it for a few days he said it made 120hz feel choppy and unplayable when he
    went back.

     I just went from 120hz to 60 and it's almost like its its not as responsive as im used to anymore. :(
    iPhone 12

     I can’t tell the difference at all . Same with 60 and 120o on my tv while gaming

     And given that it’s available in almost every phone that costs over 500 dollars, apple shouldn’t restrict
    it to just the pro models just because it’s called pro motion lol

     I have a 120hz screen and decided to turn off ProMotion because it gives me a slightly better battery life
    for no noticeable difference

     You know wrong. I am intentionally using my 15 Pro’s screen at 60hz after using it at 120hz for eight
    months. And I don’t feel any significant change. It does happen at first but slowly you adapt.

     This is not how it works for me. I routinely switch between my phones with 120 and 60 and it doesn't
    bother me in the least.

     I went from 13pro to standard 16 and really don’t notice a difference. I think people make this out to be
    a much bigger thing than it is and most people aren’t going to be able to tell a big difference and it’s
    just tech people that do

     [deleted]



 That's precisely why Apple gets away with not upgrading all iphone range to
ProMotion... Priciest 60hz phone on the planet. 
 
     Yeah it’s shitty of apple to do that, Samsung has 120hz in all of their S series. I was actually fine with
    buying the 16 but had to buy 16 pro because it’s 2024 and even cheap phones have 90hz

     And for 95% of people 60HZ is enough anyway.



 I can still manage it on a small phone but the difference on an ipad is
astronomical. That said they shouldn’t make any 60hz iphones anymore.  
 
     The 13P ruined my iPad experience. Since then I rarely use my iPad Air. The lack of use makes it hard to
    justify an iPad Pro… 😩

     On one hand, it is almost criminal to sell a 60hz display in 2024. On the other, that one single feature
    has been pushing people to move to the pro over the regular model since the iphone 13 dropped which means
    more to Apple's bottom line... I feel like until they have some groundbreaking new feature to add on the
    pro, or they do away with the regular/pro in their lineup I doubt they will give us more than 60hz on the
    regular.  Case and point: If they add 90hz or better to the regular models I would almost certainly do my
    next upgrade in a few years to the regular rather than the pro. Apple doesn't want that lol.



 Wait until you see 240hz 
 
     Wait until you see 365hz



 Going back to 60hz is pretty jarring for about 5 minutes and then my brain
forgets and it's fine again 
 


 [deleted] 
 
     I thought I couldn’t see a difference, but go to your settings And toggle “limit frame rate” (which sets
    it back to 60) on and scroll your phone for a bit… then you’ll notice a difference when you toggle it off

      I can’t tell the difference either

     Go to www.testufo.com  If you still can't see a difference then your brain is broken or something lol

     Turn low battery mode on and you’ll

     I can’t see the difference either, and disabling ProMotion gives me a slightly better battery life so I
    just keep it off

     Scroll up and down really fast and you will probably see the difference in how the text moves.   Gaming is
    where you’ll see the real difference though.   I’m not really a gamer on my phone, but it’s a night and
    day difference for PC gaming. 60Hz is almost nausea inducing for me now.  My daughter’s 60Hz monitor is
    next to my 240Hz, and the difference staggering; I have a hard time looking at her screen.



 These the same people that said who cares about 120hz lol 
 
     Yess 😂😂😂😂😂

     I mean there's definitely plenty of Apple fans that will shit on a feature until Apple gets it and then
    they love it. USBC is a good example. But there are also plenty of people that just genuinely don't care
    about this feature or don't notice it.  I don't know why everyone assumes their experiences are the same
    for everyone else. I got my first tablet with 120 and 2021 and then my first phone later that year and to
    this day I don't really care and I can switch back and forth with older phones without any issue at all. 
    In fact sometimes I'll turn it off and just forget that I turned it off.

"iPhone Screen Time showing 6+ hours of ""com.azul.zulu.java""","iPhone Screen Time showing 6+ hours of ""com.azul.zulu.java""

I found something strange in my iPhone Screen Time: an app called
""com.azul.zulu.java"" showing 6h 8min of daily usage.  Here's what makes this
bizarre: - Azul Zulu is a Java runtime for macOS/Windows/Linux - it doesn't
exist for iOS - iOS doesn't support Java applications at all - I don't have Azul
Zulu installed on my Mac - No VPN or MDM profiles on the device - TestFlight is
installed but never opened - Screen Time sync across devices is not enabled
Context: I'm actively working on a Python project in Visual Studio Code on my
Mac. The project is entirely Python-based, no Java dependencies.  I've checked:
✓ Settings > VPN & Device Management - Clean ✓ No unknown profiles ✓ TestFlight
- Never launched ✓ Mac - No Azul Zulu Java installed ✓ VS Code project - Pure
Python, no Java  The bundle identifier ""com.azul.zulu.java"" shouldn't even be
possible on an iPhone. Screen Time is actively tracking something that
technically cannot exist on iOS.  Has anyone seen this before? Is this: - A
Screen Time bug showing phantom apps from backups? - Some beta app masquerading
with this bundle ID? - Cross-device sync glitch bleeding Mac processes into
iPhone (though it's disabled)? - A security concern?  Any insights would be
appreciated. This is genuinely puzzling.

 Screen time is glitchy. It probably is showing your Mac usage. At this point I
have no idea if the iCloud sync button even does anything it just seems to do
whatever it wants lol 😭 
 
     Lol



 Screen time is not always correct. I don’t know why but I have a habit that I
watch YouTube before sleeping and I am pretty sure I turn off my screen. But
look at this. 32 hours. It is impossible.  https://preview.redd.it/8knnss8b2qyf1

     And also when I wake up I see 9 hours of screen time that YouTube accounts for around 6 or 7 hours.



 Zulu Java is used for Minecraft (on macOS, usually from a client and not

 Hey if it texts and calls. I don’t think I could make do with anything older
than the 5s haha. 
 
     I’m pretty sure he just texts and calls. He’s quite zippy with his replies though.

     I was rocking a 5c like 4 years ago. It felt pretty slow ngl. It was barely an upgrade over the cheap
    Android phone I had previously. I'm not sure if it was always that slow, or if it just got worn out over
    time.  The 5c design was so great though.

     Battery life is 45 seconds

     For me the oldest I could use is probably the 6s, preferably the Plus because I’ve gotten used to my XR’s
    larger screen

     I used a 5S in late 2017. Definitely no issues. Got a 6S in 2020.   Now have had S20+ S21+ AND S22 Ultra
    in the last 3 years. Definitely feel the need to upgrade more frequently on Android. .

     The only thing I want is to double the RAM and storage on my S5, everything else is all I need



 He’ll have to upgrade when the 3G networks get turned off 
 
     We got 2G operating until end of 2025. 3G is already off.

     Already gone in my area.

     What about heaven?



 I don’t know how people cope with old phones and how slow they are compared to
todays standards. All credit to him 
 
     Some people just need a phone to do what they need, aka messaging and calling  Others need more
    functionality so they update their equipment (smartphone)  And some just like to have the last iteration

     I had a 7 up until a few years ago. I think when you finally get a new one the revelation hits you “shit,
    I should have upgraded sooner…”

     No kidding I just had a customer recently with a OG iPhone SE I was so surprised

     The thing is; if you just stick to an old phone for as long as he did, you won’t realize how slow it is
    compared to the modern stuff. On a different level, I feel the same using my iphone 7. I’ve seen people
    complain about how slow it is, but really, for me, it’s fast enough for all I do with it lol. I’m guessing
    it’s the same for this guy.

     To Apple’s credit they kept phones updated for a long time.   I just upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus to
    the 14 Pro Max. I was on iOS 15.7 and the performance was just fine. I decided to upgrade since it didn’t
    make sense to try and replace the battery when it costs more than the phone itself at that point.

     Im actually getting desperate to downgrade my phone.   It eats at my life.   I started adding up my screen
    time. Some days 1 hour. Some days 5. Average of 3.5 hours per day.   Thats 53 days a year. Just fucking
    gone to the phone. Insane.

     Not to mention the degraded battery, I bet that thing dies in a few hours.

     Patience 😌

     I know people who still use flip phones… not smartphones

     Eh, I don't think this is admirable so much as it is just a situation where this guy only needs a dumb
    phone and this one suffices.  An iPhone 3GS won't even connect to the app store anymore and virtually all
    existing apps on it will have long ceased to work on such an old version of iOS.   I literally couldn't
    get by with this phone no matter how much I wanted to because I wouldn't be able to use my 2 factor app
    for work or use any messaging apps, etc.

     He probably uses it as… a phone.

     Compared to  There’s your issue. At the time of release the phone felt great. If you don’t touch a newer
    device you’ll never realize how much better it could be

     Chances are he’s only using it for phone calls and texting. Everything Will barely work. I still have my
    3GS kicking around. It’s really only good as a backup iPod now.

     I couldn’t deal with the 3G being slow and upgraded as soon as the 3GS came out. It was the only time I
    upgraded after one year. The 3G has 128 MB of RAM. It’s been slow from its first day.

     It's a  single core 90nm chip running at 412MHz.  So it's slow as fuck.

     Lots of people actually use phones to call and text only, which isn't slow at all.  You're talking about
    web browsers and apps and shit.

     Having used both my iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 4  recently. One fast and one ultra slow.  I can honestly say
    it’s not the speed that’s making it difficult to use an old phone. It’s the lack of app support.

     Its called having no bloody money. Still rocking my 6 still works just fine.

     Because they're used to slow. That was super fast when it was new



 That's a 3GS, not a 3G. The camera quick access on the lock screen was added in
iOS 5. The 3G can run up to iOS 4, the 3GS up to iOS 6.  If WhatsApp worked on
such old iOS versions I'd still be using my 3GS as my main phone today too. But
instead I have an SE 1 with iOS 15. And they say that's ""old""! 
 
     Kinda funny how those phones only had 2-3 years of updates. Unthinkable these days for anything Apple.

     The SE 1, and the original design it was based on (the 5), is my favorite design of all time. Super
    lightweight and easy to use with one hand. I miss those old phones.

     OG SE is the best iPhone of all time imo. Perfect size, looked good, and it’s still serviceable as a daily
    driver.

     This guy iPhones

     I’m running that setup now as my travel phone i love it



 the 3g was a fucking tank. my boyfriends son left his out on the beach overnight
during a hurricane and when he found it the next day it was working just fine.
after that he was in a pretty serious car crash out on the interstate, where
again, the phone sat out wet in the mud and wreckage for about 8 hours before it
was retrieved, phone still worked. 
 
     Yeah but it couldn’t inform him he was in a car crash so how did he know for sure?   /s

     That’s funny mine broke all the time. Drop it 1 inch on counter? Cracked screen. Get some water on it?
    Time to buy another.

     Nokia Brick: *Laughs* Come back when you've survived armageddon.



 i’m surprised the battery doesn’t deplete fully with just one phone call. 
 
     And has an OS that still allows the phone some functionality. Everything goes to shit when I don’t update
    (gps gets crazy for example). Can imagine what having a phone this old would be like

     Hint: They are replaceable.



 How does it keep working? Like that thing's battery life has to be what? An
hour? 
 
     He never really carries it on him and leaves it at home off most of the time. That’ll keep the battery
    going.



 Have a 3gs if he wants to upgrade. Still in box and never activated 
 
     This is a 3GS

     Dude. That’s a collectors item. I’ve seen them as you describe for around 1500 Euros. Of course I don’t
    know if anyone is actually paying that.

     You can make a shit load of money with that if it’s still sealed. Or you know keep it for yourself cause
    it’s an antique.

     Are you selling it ?



 A buddy of mine did the same thing for a while, he ended up upgrading 2 years
ago, but not to the newest, he upgraded to the iPhone 5C 
 
     Holy crap. I totally forgot about those! What a weird release that was.



 I imagine he doesn’t browse with it or has any apps. 
 
     I mean, it shall have few apps installed in it cause it might have the iOS 5

Why is my phone's UI different from my wife's phone?,"Why is my phone's UI different from my wife's phone?

My phone (right) has way less padding between cells and it makes it hard for me
to read the menu items. But my wife's phone (left) has a comfortable padding and
I can easily read the menu items.  Both are 15 pro Maxs. She's on ATT. I'm on T.
All display and accessibility settings appear exactly the same. I'm very
confused.

 Your wife has a secondary language on her phone that adds this extra padding. On
your phone, go to Settings > General > Language & Region, and add a language
like Arabic or Urdu, and the padding will increase. Be sure to select ""Keep
English"" so your phone doesn't speak some random language.  You can also try
adjusting the font size to make it more readable by going to Settings >
Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Larger Text. This might be even better
unless you absolutely require increased padding. 
 
     How did you know this?

     oh wow! That was it. I added Hindi and it looks good now!

     This may sound dumb but why does a second language add extra padding?

     Wow, I thought it was zoomed in lol, but now I see it’s just the area is thicker and the words are
    actually not any larger.

     This was new even to me as a UI and mobile app designer. Super interesting.

     I assume if I requested a screen time record of yours, 90% of it’ll be for settings.

     No way I just realized this. Always thought that because me and my partner were on totally different
    providers our phones looked a tad different. Duh obviously because my phone is set to english and french,
    and his is only english. I guess since my phones have always had the two keyboards I never thought any
    different.

     let us know how u obtained this knowledge so quickly o wise one

     Your answer was so good that it made people feel proud of Reddit. Your answer was so good it made people
    nostalgic about the past.

     Just out of curiosity, *why* does having a secondary language affect padding?

     U fulltime tech-wizard or what

     Perfect ,  Can you also explain about why adding another language impact the padding ?

     Im going all r/conspiracy : she’s cheating

     Interesting. I have a second keyboard (Russian) on my phone and the spacing is just like OP’s on the right
    side. Is there that much of a difference with a different type of language? Didn’t realize this was even
    an issue in my settings, but you’ve piqued my curiosity.

     Why would adding a specific second language cause the padding to increase?

     I wonder why there is extra padding if you have a secondary language, it doesn't make sense. Am I missing
    something?

      But how do you even knew it broo!😯

     Just noticed I had the padding due to a language I never used, but it’s very bad without it

     Omg you have no idea how you’ve helped me with such an insanely rare problem that I didn’t even know how
    to google.

     Came here to say this.

     As a big techie that thought I knew how to fix everything, would’ve never solved this or even thought of
    this. 👏👏👏

     We have the exact same issue! Thank you!!!!

     There’s also Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom > Larger Text so you don’t have to go into
    Accessibility.

     How the hell did you know this.

     Me and my boyfriend have been trying to figure this out for MONTHS!!!! Thank you for solving!!!!!!!

     Why don’t they just add a padding option?

     Any chance you know how to solve this issue on a MBP? Feels like Finder has too much padding!

     You're a legendary Pokemon.

     Wow you're amazing

     This girl apples.

     If awards were still a thing. You deserve it.

     Wow that’s incredible lol. I have been wondering why mine looks different from my partner’s and I have
    Spanish as my other language.

     Yes, I accidentally changed my phone to Korean and thankfully I lived in a university town and found a
    student from South Korea who was willing to change my phone back to English for me.



 Thank you OP for helping me realize that I need a Hindi keyboard on my phone 
 


 The only rational explanation is that she is sleeping with another man. 
 
     Lol such an underrated comment



 This goes back all the way to iOS 4 where if you had a SECONDARY language option
in iOS, the UI elements get spaced out. Text size remains the same but there is
a lot of padding to compensate for different languages. Also, it was most likely
done so text like ""This"" doesn't appear as ""Thi..."" in some parts of the UI. But
this applies to different languages. 
 


 Did you check Display Zoom? 
 


 Where did you find the time to notice this difference? 
 
     probably was one of them was showing the other how to do something in the settings or sharing wifi
    passwords or something when they noticed that one of them had to scroll to access the action while the
    other didn’t

     Same place you found time to post your comment.

     You mean you never had to mess with your spouse’s phone?



 Prob has Zoom/Normal display enabled 
 


 It's the font and zoom size difference. 
 
     The real answer



 I'm convinced that not everybody goes through almost every setting menu just to
see what it does. just living life raw dogging it through settings at default.
&#x200B;  like not using the accessibility feature in quick menu to turn off
white point so you scroll at night without it being super bright.  Edit: Go to
Accessibility > display > reduce white point > set at 100% > turn off > go to
Accessibility shortcut > check on white point.  Now go back out to setting and
go to control center and include the accessibility shortcuts.  Now you can swipe
down to the control center on the right side of the screen and you can quickly
lower the screen brightness at night when scrolling. Your welcome.  Also try
youtube top iPhone iOS17+ settings to have to find more interesting ones. 
 
     No I literally just buy a new phone and download the apps I need and make the calls I need to make lol.

     this comment just saved my eyeballs

     I look through the settings but still missed the reduce white point feature so now I added it as a short
    cut whenever I hold assistive touch

     This is honestly one of my favorite features. I was astounded when I learned you could do this.  Only
    downside is a couple times I’ve forgotten to turn off Reduce White Point the next morning and then
    wondered why I couldn’t read my phone in bright daylight. Doh!

     Woahhhh I stopped here for raw dogging and I’ll be damned if I didn’t learn something in addition. Win
    win. Appreciate you!!!

     My eyeballs thank you fr

 If you can’t get the code then you need to put your phone in recovery mode and
restore it. Then you have to set it up without transferring your data (set up as
new). If you setup from your backup, it’ll keep the screen time locked.

Does any of you actually use this to launch an app?,"Does any of you actually use this to launch an app?

Most of the time, I use Spotlight to open an app. Then I sometimes I use the
Home Screen. But I've never ever used the one on the screenshot.    If I need to
launch an app, I don't really need to think which app category it belongs to. It
just seems pointless. But what about you? Have you find any good use for this?

 I have occasional brain-freeze and can't remember a name of an app that I need
at the moment. Then I use App Library while cursing myself and my senile head.
:/  When I'm normal I use spotlight. 
 
     This. I'd rather use spotlight search and customize my home screen the old way than deal with this shit.
    First you have to swipe all the way to the right to access it (if you don't have many home screens, it's
    fine). Second, ""zero"" customization options. ios automatically categories everything the way it wants and
    there's no way to change it whatsoever. I sometimes have to scroll all the way down and go in and out of
    some categories to find what I am looking for or to reach hidden folder. Why?? How is this intuitive
    Apple??

     What really grinds my gears is when the app I want is in a category with four or fewer apps (there are no
    labels and you can’t open the category view to see the labels), so I have to remember this app I never use
    by its _icon_.



 Yea all the time actually, that or I just swipe down to search. 
 
     I swipe down and search every time. I don’t even look for the icon

     Same. I have a couple widgets + Smart Stack on one screen, smart home apps pinned on a second; everything
    else is either from the app folders page or swipe down.

     Didn’t know you could just swipe down! Thanks lol

     I started doing this😂 but only because I upgraded to the 16pm so I wanted a cleaner Home Screen and
    completely removed most apps

     Same

     Search is becoming one of my most used features lol

     Same!! Half the time its not on home screen so i look for it

     Swiping down is The way

     Same

     Likewise, depending on my focus mode I have different home screen apps, and if I need an app not on my
    home screen page then either use Spotlight or go into the App Library to search for it

     Same for me since I have a minimal homepage setup

     same, i have like three apps I actually get to on my home screen

     Zero for me

     Same.  I don't even look for the app .. Just swipe and search.

     This is the way



 People who prefer a minimalist home screen use this 
 
     Was just going to comment. I only use a Home Screen of my main apps so when I swipe right library comes
    up. I use it all of the time.

     my Home Screen is only one page, all other apps go on that screen

     Well, I have only 1 page and 4 apps there, it covers around 90% of my usage. Spotlight suggestions on
    widget screen and I pretty much don’t use anything else on the phone 🙂

     But… wouldn’t it be faster to swipe down and search?

     I tried this. Would be be great if the folders didn’t move around but as it is that’s a deal breaker

     People who prefer minimalist home screen create one folder named “Useless” and put all this shit inside. I
    don’t need a separate screen for all the apps.

     have 3 pages of shit; still start calculator, findmy, and discord through this page.



 All the time. Cos I only have 1 page in my Home Screen. And that’s all the apps
there are in it.  https://preview.redd.it/o6t7h4psi1pe1.jpeg?width=1179&format=p
jpg&auto=webp&s=1adbc20cb3936320aefc721da4935a877983e3d9 
 
     I have the same usecase for my work phone. Put the one that i most frequently used in the first page, and
    when i need other app, just swipe.

     just curious why messages is on your home screen instead of the bottom bar? like from your perspective why
    not put the folder of apps on your home screen and messages on the bottom bar next to phone?

     Bro spent $15 on a calculator app

     People will do this to be “minimalist” but then have 627 unread notifications

     Damn I switched to the Galaxy s25 ultra this month from using an iPhone for 7 years. I'm just now
    realizing how boring the home screens and customization is on iOS. lol  I am now so used to being able to
    customize every tiny detail of this phone and make it deeply personalized to me. I could be in a room with
    50 other people with the same phone as me and it's wild how none of them would remotely look the same at
    all. It was overwhelming at first, but I could never go back. lol



 I actually deleted the whole pages and use this to navigate instead 
 
     Yup



 No, I still use my iPhone like it was before all this.   I’ll occasionally use
search if I can’t find an app, but my icons are laid out like they’ve been since
the beginning back with iPhone 3G, so it’s all muscle memory. 
 
     My app layout is still that of an iPhone 6s lol

     This is the way.  I’ve been using iPhones since 3G as well, before it has the App Library, before folders
    even. I have 3 pages of apps and folders, and very rarely use the library. I’d search it first before
    using the library.



 I use it all the time. It’s a great feature once you understand what it does. I
have over 500 apps on my phone. I used to have multiple home screens with
carefully curated folders to organize all of these apps. Now I just have one
Home Screen with my most used apps and I swipe over to the App Library to access
the rest.  The genius of the App Library is that it continuously reorganizes the
apps based on your usage of them. So the apps that you use in a category the
most will bubble up to one of the 3 positions for instant access in the
category. And the categories themselves will bubble up to the top of the Library
based on which category of apps you are using the most.  This means that the
apps you are currently using most frequently are always the most easily
accessible in the App Library. It’s awesome. 
 
     This also means that we can all tell what apps you use the most. Safari, Find My, and Calculator. 🤔

     Came to the comments section to see if someone made this point. This is exactly why I use the app library
    all the time.    It gets the same apps up to the top all the time and then I start to remember where they
    are in the app library and boom I've got effectlively a second home screen page with all the apps I use
    the most besides the ones on the home screen.



 All the time 
 


 I use it quite often along with the search. 
 


 Yes because I have no apps on my homescreen. Just swipe down to search or go to
the app library.

 Restart your screen time tracking, just turn it off and back on , should fix it

 It might be the website, if you use a single website long enough it can show up
there. I’ve seen a similar bug where some news site I’d read an article on
started showing as constant screen time for a few days. I ended up just closing
all my tabs and it went away 
 
     I’ve since deleted history and that seems to have removed it. I’ve also set a daily limit of 1 min for
    Weibo in screen time setting - not sure if that’ll do anything tho.

    years and I had no issues



 Do you leave them open, like in your app switcher? That might be the case. 
 
     No, all those apps were closed and weren’t even left on in the background for at least 30 mins or an hour



 Having the same problem. I briefly checked the UPS app and it says I used it for
1h17 and I def didn’t leave it open in the background. Same with a telehealth

soon.

Limit adult websites is the best iPhone feature,"Limit adult websites is the best iPhone feature

So, I moved to iPhone with the 16e two months ago. Have been a mac user as much
as I’ve been an android user, around ten years. With adhd symptoms I used to
scroll the web and nsfw a lot.  On mac I could use the cold turkey blocker but
to do that on phone,  nothing worked well. All the android focus and restriction
apps could be bypassed by installing more apps.  I was distressed to the point
of giving up smartphones altogether. I rocked dumbphones with an iPad from last
two years.  Finally took the plunge of paying a premium to get the iPhone over
Android.  However, things have been uphill since then.  I found this really nice
paid app Routinery that helps with my focus.   At the same time, freedom, opal
or other blocking apps didn't really block adult content entirely.   However
Apple's in-built feature of limiting adult websites has been working flawlessly.
I've set it up with a partner for screentime passcode with their Apple ID that I
made for them. Along with blocking new app installation, this is now working
flawlessly as well as free for me. So I guess it was worth buying the iPhone.
I wish I had got the iPhone earlier and saved a lot of time but my open-source
friends discouraged it killer hell. If I have to buy a phone for my kids ten
years into the future, I'll get an iPhone.

 There’s plenty of us with ADHD that aren’t addicted to porn so please don’t
conflate the two.   I’m glad this iOS feature is helping you with your porn
addiction.

    are converging together.

     Convergent evolution?

     Unrestrained Capitalism requires infinite growth. This is what the end stage looks like. To keep

 I don't like Android as a product but I'm very glad it exists in the sense that
Apple with a complete monopoly on smartphones would not be good for anyone.

themselves as a viable 3rd player in the space so we weren't left with a
duopoly, but here we are. 
 
     I do like Android, and I like how both iOS and Android have a symbiotic relationship. Every time one OS
    gets something useful you can bet the other one will get it soon. Like iOS copying the Notification Center
    and Android copying Do Not Disturb. Both OSes need to exist to keep interesting features coming for all

    wait to see iOS 26 next month.

     What don't you like about Android ""as a product""?

     I have android and iPhone and think android is better in every way. I can respect that opinion

     Windows Phone was such a missed opportunity.

     Well in the end Google, Samsung and others pay Apple 20 cents per phone because of licensing multi-touch
    patents and other patents. Also there was a couple of multiyear court cases that Apple won.

     I hate Android for that everything they now - is copying iPhone. Everything, including bad decisions. It’s
    not real competition, it’s copying.



 This is so cringe. Apple and Google have been copying each other for years. 
 
     I don't understand this post lol. You go scroll a lil further on this sub you'll see people saying apple
    copied pixels camera ""visor"" and made it uglier.

     Android is a complete copy of the iPhone. It was supposed to be a feature phone operating system. When the
    team saw what Apple had done, they delayed and tried to rework Android with as much as they could copy
    from the iPhone reveal. It took *years* to even approach feature parity, and it was still short for a few
    more. There are documentaries on the birth of Android if you didn’t live through it.  I gotta respect
    Microsoft for going in an entirely different direction with Windows Phone. I wish they stuck it out,
    because it was far more polished than Android at the time, IMO, and had compelling features without being
    a resource hog. It also wasn’t a blatant ripoff of the iPhone.

     Apple doesn't copy google...



 Imitation is the new innovation. 
 
     Has been for many many years now

     That's all Apple does with iOS updates lol.  Features that have been on Android for years and Apple
    finally includes them in a ""major release"" and claims they're the innovative ones



 The truth is, most companies imitate Apple from their website design to their
phone design because it's the most desired smartphone brand in the world. 
 
     As someone who works in web design, I get sooooo many briefs that list an Apple product page as the
    inspiration. Usually they don’t have the assets or budget to make something like that 😂

     Everybody copies everybody

     Yep. Samsung became number 2 by copying to the limit everything Apple has made. Samsung phones. I know
    they are a huge conglomerate but they do this across product lines. It’s not surprising at all Google or
    any other OEM does this. I will say tho, I’ve gotten day one iPhone deliveries consistently since that was
    a thing…. I cannot say the same for many other companies

     Everyone copies Apple. Or is it Apple is never first but they do it the Apple way? Or is it we should just
    wait for the next iOS release? 



 Whoever is most popular gets copied 
 


 Ask Samsung the same thing. S23 ultra was the last remnant of innovation for
them. 
 
     S23 - S25 Ultra are the same exact phones with some minor aesthetic changes.



 Google and Apple are just becoming one singular phone company, Google copies the
website and the features and apple copies the pixel style 
 
     Under the skin, they function and operate with very different motivations as discrete platforms.

     What pixel style did apple copy?   isn’t pixel the one which made pixel 9 look like iphones with the flat
    design?

     He does not know what a dent is and does not know what part of the phone is the screen.

     THE ONE WITHT EH WHITE CIRCLE 🤣



 This is a 16 pro right? How did you manage to beat it up so much? That level of
scratches can’t be just from sitting in a case. 
 
     in my experience it's typical if you work / spend a lot of time outside  dirt and little pebbles just find
    their way in all the time

     Yes it definitely can, my 16 pro was incredibly easy to scratch. So much so that I’ll never buy a black
    phone again

     Mine looks the same.   A lot of field work in my pocket in dusty areas I try and remove my case daily and
    clean it… it’s just part of working outside, especially me where my phone is attached to my equipment for
    hours.

     The clear apple cases genuinely are horrible for protecting against edge scratches/debris

     Definitely happens, I work in a mechanics shop and dirt, grime, metal shavings, etc get all inside the
    case and accumulate in the edges. The flexing and stuff of the case rubs it in, mine didn’t have as bad
    scratches but I had the same color 15 pro and you could see the outline of the case when it was off

     People trashing 17’s aluminum and praising 16’s titanium for scratches need to look at this thread, lol.

     now it looks rugged now lol

     Because OP used Apples own clear case which is a hard case and not a soft/TPU case. So any debris that got
    between in it and device would surely scratch it to hell and back.

     It’s that clear Apple case. I had it too and it scratched the phone to hell even if I stayed on top of
    cleaning it.



 I see nothing but some light scratches on the frame?

    4b01a89175da  It’s only a tiny dent but my trade it got reduced from £500 to £160 saying my screen was
    broken. Nightmare… this wasn’t Apple tho I may try get trade in credit as it has Apple care. Or maybe just
    return my new one 😩

     Light scratches he said 😳



 Is this another rage bait post? 
 


 User fault cosmetic damage. Clean your case man. What good does a case do if
there’s sand or dirt in it? Also, “this wasn’t Apple tho I may try get trade in
credit as it has Apple care.” What?? You got a quote from someone other than
Apple and are upset about it? Take it to the manufacturer, always. 
 
     Some people never remove their cases, which is baffling. They spill stuff on the phone, drop it in the
    sand, and never think to take the case off to clean inside it.

     I remove the case almost every day to wipe it down with a microfibre cloth. No idea how people cope with
    dirty ass phones.



 Smash the screen and use apple care 
 
     In my country if you go to Apple Store with broken display they change only the broken display….

     I know this is not cool and all but would this actually work and would they also replace the frame ?

     Pro tip: smash the camera lens, they can’t replace it. They’ll charge you $100 for a new device if it’s on
    Apple Care+ Mine got smashed during show down between me and a brainless lime scooter rider, new device
    the same day.

     Then come back here and ask “why is apple care so expensive?”

     I don’t think I can do that 😆🤪



 Holy OCD 🤪 
 


 Is the dent in the room with us? 
 


 The scratches are common for hard clear cases… it’s not damaging the product,
just dust between making micro movements constantly. Always good to remember and
people always seem to be so sure it doesn’t happen. Clear cases are nice for
product you don’t carry around. 
 
     Been using a clear case in a 12 pro max for 4+ years and the frame doesn’t have a single scratch

     I’ve never had it with any other apple case that’s all. Lesson learned

     Yeah got a silicone one this time for the 17 pro, was fuming that Apple sold such a bad case. 😩



 Cases don’t scratch phones. Have you ever cleaned than phone in a year? If you
work in a dust environment it’s understandable, but you have to remove the case
and clean it,  because this is what happens. Doesn’t matter what case you have,
if it gets dust/sand between phone and case it’s the same result.

iPhone XR's copy has been changed on Apple's homepage for the third time,"iPhone XR's copy has been changed on Apple's homepage for the third time



 [deleted] 
 
     All they need to do is lower the price then people would upgrade!

     The only thing surprising to me about the XR is that they thought it would be popular. It's not cheap
    enough to be ""the cheap iPhone,"" and aside from battery life, I can't see why someone might pick it over
    an XS. At this price point, I think most people looking for an upgrade would pick a used X over the XR.
    Just as perplexing as their anticipation the XR would be a hit is that they seemed to have under estimated
    the appeal of the XS Max. The X was a huge step forward for iPhone, but some of us ""upgraded"" to it from a
    Plus sized phone and missed the larger form factor all last year.  I'm sure people who bought an XR have
    plenty of reasons to be happy with it, but it is a really strange product that is full of compromises at a
    price that shouldn't have any. This misleading advertising about the price seems to indicate that they've
    also realized the price is what is killing this phone.

     [Like this?](https://i.imgur.com/4IUBxz2.jpg)

     [Tim Cook crying](https://giphy.com/gifs/cmt-YlbxzD78WJYeQ)

     Good please lower all prices

     I thought the XR was considered the sweet spot for price/quality right now?    Are they bad or just not
    selling well due to other reasons? Was going to trade my 6S in for one. $200 off makes it pretty damn
    cheap.

     I’ll give you $3.50.

     They should have rolled out the xr as the 5.8” option for $50 less and made the xs 6.1” or something

     You do realize apples inventory management is one of the best .



 Looks like users of iPhone 7 and below are getting push notifications from the
Apple Store app urging users to upgrade to the XR as
well.https://i.imgur.com/7p9tWo4.jpg 
 
     Omg the desperation.

     Holy shit talk about desperation!

     Damn, are sales really that low if they're resorting to this? Almost makes you feel bad for them...almost.

     hell I got it on my X lmao

     I actually got one of those alerts a few ago lol

     That is somewhat pathetic – and I'm saying this a long time Apple ""fan"" and user.  Meh..

     Can confirm: i got one of those and a couple of emails too  I replaced the screen on my iPhone and bought
    a different non-apple phone.   If I have anything that is iOS exclusive, I'll use the 7. I'm done paying
    apple ridiculous amounts of money for a good phone. The pricing on this year's lineup was a slap in the
    face

     Absolutely plebian

     I didn’t, even they don’t want my old 6...

     For clarification, if I’m reading this message right, I believe this is informing a user who is paying for
    the iPhone Upgrade Program that they can go in to get their upgrade. They’re just informing.

     [deleted]

     I mean the only purpose of this app is to buy new apple products. So when you download it and turn on
    notifications, what do you expect?

     I have a 7 and have gotten no such notifications. The secret is to shut off notifications for the Apple
    store.



 Great job crack marketing team 😛 
 
     [deleted]



 Next one will be “C’mon guys, it’s not that bad...”  P.S. Just kidding, I think
it’s underestimated... 
 
     [deleted]

     I'd like to actually know how people notice things like this.

     I’m an Apple fanboy and love the XR. My last phone was an X. The XR screen is fantastic and I don’t miss
    3D Touch. I only used it on the keyboard. Was the X sexier? Yep. But it was also a lot more money. The XS
    simply isn’t worth the $250 premium over the XR in my opinion.

     I'd argue it's over estimated. The screen is awful.



 If this phone was 599 it would have been ultra competitive... 
 
     Apple has been trying everything BUT lowering their prices.

     [deleted]

     And honestly that's what their low end phone should cost... at most.  If I didn't get a b1g1 deal from my
    carrier I'd still be on the 6.  And honestly I'm not nearly as happy with the XR as I thought I'd be.  I
    think the better camera is the best improvement.  I'm not a power user though.

     At 600 still would have been shitty. Not even a 1080p screen, that's just sad. 499 and yeah, maybe

     When I first heard about a budget iPhone I figured sub $500 was the sweet spot. I still think that’s true
    when you consider the huge compromises the XR is compared to the XS



 I need to trade my old iphone to get a new one. Do i get that correct?  &#x200B; 
 
     I think that price is for a 7 plus but may be mistaken.

     Yeah I gave in my 6S which I’m glad I did, no one would’ve bought it for sure and the battery life was
    dying. I instantly got 200$ towards one of the new phones XS for 799$ or XR for 549$. They didn’t even
    check my 6S lol but everything was working anyways.



 thats clickbait false advertisement. ""from 449"" if you trade in a phone worth
300... fuckin apple 
 
     “You can get this $100 gift card for only $10 if you also give us $90 worth of something else”.

     Nope, not even. Your phone needs to be worth far more than that to get the $300.



 The desperation is ramping up each iteration... 
 
     Serves the wankers right! It’s nothing but pure greed that caused the prices of these phones to become
    ridiculous, I’m glad it’s backfiring on them.



 THIS IS ONLY FOR A 7-PLUS TRADE IN. GO READ THE ASTERISK! 
 
     OKAY THANKS



 I love how misleading it is. The phone is totally worth $450, but it's still
priced at $750, and they just make it look like it's $450 unless you read the
fine text.  &#x200B;  Stop making your good phones expensive, and your bad
phones expensive Apple. 
 
     Definitely agree that it can be misleading for people who don’t notice the asterisk

     Even worse with the laptops. Wish they would have lowered prices on the second best.

     I'd trade mine in if it comes with my apple care warranty for another year. I purchased the iPhone 8 plus
    last Black Friday but my fingers are always clammy or super dry.

     Well the iPhone XR isn’t a bad phone either.

"Apple releasing iOS 14 public beta today with redesigned home screen, widgets, more","Apple releasing iOS 14 public beta today with redesigned home screen, widgets, more



 Sign up for the Apple Beta Software Program
[here](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/).   ~~Page currently says iOS 14,
Big Sur, and watchOS 7 public betas are “Coming Soon” so sit tight.~~  iOS,
iPadOS, and tvOS 14 public betas now available! 
 
     Thanks bro!! Saved me a search.

     Just let me sign up!

     Score! Thank you! I don’t know why I never considered looking into getting public betas before

     How stable is the public beta? I've been debating on giving it a try. Hopefully Big Surs gets a public
    beta as well. I love giving feedback.

     Legend

     Is it worth jumping to the public if you're on development?

     Is iPadOS beta out too?



 PSA: if you install iOS 14 and watchOS 7 be aware of this: you can’t go back to
watchOS 6 and therefore you’ll either need to stay on the iOS 14 beta or leave
your watch behind until fall 
 
     Good info to know. Thank you.

     You can also send it into Apple for them to downgrade it too.

     Silly question but I have a gen1 Apple Watch running on iOS 4.3.2 should I worry about this?  I know I
    should but a newer better watch but it’s still working fine.

     Dumb question, new watch owner: can you upgrade the watch to OS 7 but keep the phone on 13 or do they have
    to move together? I’m jailbroken so I rarely update my phone.  Edit: thanks reddit, sorry for asking a
    relevant question...



 PSA: critical apps, such as banking apps may break when updating to the beta. So
be sure to have another device where you can access them to their full capacity.
Edit: Grammar 
 
     Simple, Chase, PayPal and Navy Federal are all good.

     This sub needs a bot to post this every time a title has beta in it.

     Both my banking apps work perfectly fine on the beta.

     Can confirm that PNC, Discover, Simple, Chime, and Chase bank apps have been working for me and my
    friends.

     USAA detects your phone is jailbroken but you can just accept the risk it asks you to take and it’s all
    good.

     Not a banking app, but BlueJeans video conferencing app crashes when you try to join a meeting.  I assume
    it has something to do with the new camera/mic privacy settings in iOS 12.  My company uses it, that's the
    only reason I have it.  Things like this are one reason I don't install on my primary iPhone.
    Conveniently my former iPhone X is my beta device.

     Monzo, HSBC, NatWest, Tesco, Virgin Money, Halifax all working since the first dev beta.  ---  This is
    because Apple have removed the `/etc/fstab` directory from being able to be used for jailbreak detection.
    There was a [thread about
    it](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/hn1oln/public_beta_2_weakens_third_party_app_jailbreak/)
    after it was published in the [Beta 2 release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-
    release-notes/ios-ipados-14-beta-release-notes):  > `fstab` has been removed. Filesystem contents outside
    of an app’s sandbox can no longer be used for validation. (61098152)  App's  usually check the size of
    this directory to see if there is a jailbreak  present, because they no longer can, its fooling a lot of
    apps into  thinking that they are jailbroken. Until they release a patch to fix it!

     Confirming SoFi and Citi are working fine.

     USAA appears to work fine after it bitches about the phone being jailbroken.  I had to close it, then
    reopen it and hit ""accept risk,"" then it's like normal again.

     Ally seems to be working.

     damn gotta pass then, i need to be on my bank and etrade constantly.

     Another PSA: you’ll almost certainly regret upgrading on your main device. These public betas are known to
    be very unstable.

     For anybody in Malaysia: Maybank is good

     Some already listed, but Huntington, Chase, Citi, Discover, Capital One, PayPal, and Bluebird all work for
    me so far.

     HSBC, American Express, Discover, Capital One, Vanguard, TD Ameritrade thinkorswim are all OK

     Confirm Nationwide works fantastically

     Marcus by Goldman Sach isn’t working for me FYI

     Can anyone confirm Wells Fargo?

     NYT Crosswords app doesn’t work, annoyingly  Edit: ignore, I think it’s unrelated. Seems to be global.

     Also, also, If you have Apple Watch you might have to update WatchOS to beta, as well. Otherwise it might
    fuck things up.   (At least, I had this problem with iOS13)

     While I would love to try out the beta, this is the reason that keeps me from ever trying g it.

     I can at least confirm USAA, Chase, Cash/Venmo and Discover are working for me. USAA was blocked due to a
    “jailbreak” for the first couple days of the dev beta but its working now.

     Thanks mate, it’s my first iPhone and I use it to pay in stores. I had no idea

     TD app confirmed broken- has always crashed on every beta release I’ve ever used



 BACKUP YOUR DEVICE BEFORE SWITCHING TO BETA. Uninstalling beta requires erasing
your device. Be smart people. Jus sayin 
 
     Yep. A while ago I downloaded the beta then tried to downgrade with iTunes’ update function like a
    dumbass. Phone was stuck in a bootloop. Had to throw it in Recovery Mode and restore, luckily I made a
    backup before I upgraded to the beta.

     I assume upgrading from beta to the official release isn’t considered “uninstalling” the beta? (First time
    on an iOS device)

     I just installed it and was greeted with ""login to attempt data recovery"" and that's going now.  Glad I
    did that iTunes update before incase.

     no it doesn't. Simply remove the profile and wait for the next general update. It's that simple.



 Any notable broken apps on the latest dev? 
 
     Pokemon Go, Harry Potter Wizards Unite, Amazon Music

     I’m also interested in this.

     twitter a bit glitchy

     Spotify and Apple Music don’t work for me

     The Marcus Goldman Sachs app seems to be broken on it as well - crashes every time I launch it

     BlueJeans crashes the moment it tries to access the microphone or camera.  Slack will occasionally bug out
    and hide the channel browser.



 Dev beta has worked well. Battery life took a slight hit, and phone has randomly
rebooted once a day. Will be switching to public beta once available. 
 
     Public beta 1 will most likely be the same build as the current developer beta.

     I’ll likely still move over to the public profile moving forward since there is a delay on the public beta
    compared to dev and it can save you from a rough dev build, and towards the end of the beta program it
    gets pushed 10 minutes to an hour after the dev channel.

     Any idea why beta has taken 24 Gb of extra space in “other” . Or is it not normal . *first time beta user*

     Do you know if the Smart Battery case issue is resolved in the public beta?

     direful glorious elderly subtract quiet alleged grandiose live pathetic books -- mass edited with
    redact.dev

     Is it as simple as deleting the Dev profile and adding the Public beta profile?

     Yeah this is my main driver. I prefer waiting a few days.

     How stable is it to run daily because I’d like the corona tracing working?

     I’ve been using my main device to beta since iOS 10

     Agreed.  The only thing I’ve had issues with both this version and last is CarPlay. Each app icon is on
    its own page and Google Maps has been glitchy even though it’s worked fine not connected to CarPlay.

     I might try this one out then. I remember the ios7 betas being absolute garbage for battery life. My
    iPhone 5 was getting something like 4 hours max, standby included. Haven’t tried a beta since



 I never install betas on my devices, but I cant stand the full screen incoming
call notification. So here we go... 
 
     It’s a nice change.

     Same



 I know WWDC was late this year but I wasn’t expecting a public beta so early in
the process. 
 
     I'd much rather have an extended public beta period in order to catch as many bugs and issues as possible
    than having to wait and go through several revisions at launch like we did with iOS 13.



 I switched to Public Beta now. Can i update from Dev Beta 2 to Public Beta 1 or
they are same builds ?

 Also tells if the flight is delayed, the gate number, I love it 
 
     Only issue is that not all airlines support the real time changes or they’re not always reliable. But when
    they are it’s such a nice quality of life feature

     i used Apple Wallet only for when i went on a connected flight to canada, two and a half years ago, worked
    like a dream

     Wow

     I'd LOVE to see that in the Live Activities feature.

     If and only if the airline provides that information.

     Do not trust the gate and delay.     I always check the board to see what gate it says.    I have had more
    than once that the gate chance notice comes to my phone once I am sitting on the plane waiting for
    everyone to board.

     But I thought Apple Wallet was great for concert tickets because it specifically didn't need internet
    connection



 Yes, because when you press on it, you get your boarding pass, which is super
easy when boarding! 
 
     Should be allowed to dismiss it



 So does any other time sensitive ticket in Wallet, hotel key cards, cinema
tickets, etc. 
 
     I don’t know how you guys fit all these things in your wallet, my iPhone will not fold all the way. It’s
    folding more every day, but it’s still uncomfortable to sit on. 🤷‍♂️

     How do you add those things?

     How is a hotel key card “time sensitive”?



 Been there for years no? 
 
     Yeah, but today was OP’s first flight

     Since iOS 6, yes.

     https://xkcd.com/1053/

     I remember using it on my 3GS. Loved that phone so much!

     I’m always blown away when I see people lining up to get their printed boarding pass.



 It’s one of those convenient features I love. Awesome when going to the movies
as it even pops up on the Apple Watch and it’s super quick. 
 
     Is the Apple Watch's screen big enough to comfortably scan the code? If so, that's an awesome feature!!



 It’s been there for years 
 
     Is it available for all geographies?



 [deleted] 
 
     Yes, I think either devs choose the duration or it’s decided per category (trains, planes, others?,…)



 It's nice, but I want the ability to dismiss it. Concerts and sporting events
for example, that damn thing stays on the entire event. I don't need that. 
 
     You can close the individual notifications (swipe left or long press), remove the pass from your wallet,
    or turn this feature off entirely in the wallet settings.

     Honest question - why does it bother you? It’s just a tiny strip on the lock screen.

     Yes i want this also android does it that way Apple needs to follow suit

     [deleted]



 Seriously. I still can't believe Apple hasn't changed this annoying placement.
You have this useless notch area. Makes total sense. 
 


 I personally report the giant pop-up as a bug every single update. If enough
people start doing it enough it might get their attention. 
 
     [deleted]



 Funny thing is in iOS 11 dev beta the Hud was gone and replaced for some simple
tweak that made the volume look like it does in Instagram videos.  When they
released the public beta, it was gone and the Hud was back.  Doesn’t even make
any sense. 
 


 this has been posted like 6 times now 
 
     Ooops, didn't know. Oh well, the more it gets around the better.

     Yeah, but this one of the few things that everyone seems to love to talk about.  If they actually changed
    the volume indicator, this sub would lose like 20% if its content.



 Going to against the grain on this one:  I don’t think Apple’s solution is
perfect, but I often think my volume buttons are broken when I’m in Apollo or
other apps with minimal UI because I’m not seeing the button presses register.
This is largely when audio is not actually playing, when I’m turning it down
before I think something may play.  I miss the iOS 6 overlay, its the blur that
makes Apple’s current version obnoxious for me. 
 
     Blue?

     That’s something you can adjust to. It’s just a different place to look for it.

     I tend to agree. I oft wonder if my volume indicator is working when, say, playing a video on Twitter (I'm
    guessing Twitter's custom indicator is broken, like everything else). And when I'm needing to quickly
    glance at my volume to adjust it, it's instrumental to have a large overlay over a discreet small one.

     I agree. There is a better way to do apple's popup, but this is not it. It's way not obvious enough,
    especially on a screen tall like that   Apps that show a bar with no volume icon are even stupider

     > I often think my volume buttons are broken when I’m in Apollo or other apps with minimal UI because I’m
    not seeing the button presses register.  I thought I was going crazy for a while but I'm glad to hear it's
    not only me thinking this.

     You’d most likely get used to it if it was changed system wide as it’s generally unexpected in apps but
    not system wide.



 I upvoted for the monstars 
 
     Me too:)

     Truly a historic upset.

 I’m pretty sure this is going to interact with the rumored always on display
they’re introducing with the 14 Pro, so it’s delayed because they can’t give
developers all the details without leaking their own phone. 
 
     [deleted]

     Its honestly hilarious that always on is a « pro feature » i had on my android in 2015. I like iphones
    quite a bit, but apple is pretty up its own ass in terms of the whole « we wait to do it right »
    mentality. So far the best aspects are the build quality and design. Oh and i do enjoy iMessage.  Since
    I’ve switched to iPhone, there’s nothing I’d say it does better. Just differently, or with different
    steps.  (Most times MORE steps)  Apple music is bloated as well, better than itunes, but still a bit of a
    mindfuck compared to Spotify. Also find it annoying that podcasts are a separate app.  Face ID is at once
    absolutely amazing and also fucking annoying. The leaning over to open my phone if it’s on a desk or
    plugged in, ~~how if you’re using someone else’s iPhone it takes a while to get to entering the
    passcode~~. Basically, Face ID is amazing when the device is in your hand. It gets annoying when that is
    not the case.   I really don’t know which biometric i’d chose between fingerprint and face ID.  I don’t
    like control center, and how one of the places you have go to the most becomes a two handed gesture
    because the phone is too big.  (Dont even have the Max). I think one of the biggest downsides of losing
    the home button is that now you have to swipe from the TOP to get to controls/notifications. This had been
    aided in Androids by adding swiping on the fingerprint sensor to bring your control center down. But apple
    doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor, so again you’re stuck going all the way to the top right of the screen.
    Also, by slowly removing the notch in future phones, (bizarrely a fucking pro feature too lol), it becomes
    less clear where to swipe down from to get to these two panels.  I have control center set as my Back Tap
    button as well, but it only recognizes the Back Tap like 1/3 to 1/2 of the time. I think I’d legit have a
    smaller control center button beneath the power button on the side of the phone. Though i may be pushing
    it.

     and by the time iOS 17 releases, we might get 4 apps supporting the feature.

     Will the 13 range have always on displays as well in future updates?

     Why would they do it an iPhone 14 only feature? At least make it work on the devices that have an oled/
    Retina display

     What details are there to be leaked lol



 This isn’t news, they said the same at dub dub 
 
     dee see



 I'm not sure how many people adapt to these changes. Most app devs will be lazy,
save costs and not bother about it. 
 
     Fully agree, only so many apps support widgets properly. I can only imagine how long it will take to have
    support for this

     From the teaser in WWDC I presume one of the largest apps to support it will be Uber, so the other
    delivery/ rideshare apps may compete to also have the same fancy feature. Otherwise I think you’re right

     [deleted]

     You could say that about many apps and app features that are staples at this point, Apple probably has
    some major sway towards these “AAA” so-to-speak apps, like ESPN and Uber. Smaller ones, sure.



 [deleted] 
 
     It was already announced at WWDC this would be the case.

     Is already active with the beta im on



 Beta 4 has the code for it. So it’s possible it’s being tested right now 
 
     It’s not gonna be in 16.0. Maybe 16.1 or 16.2.  Read the article, Apple did indeed release the API in beta
    4, but they publicly just said the feature will not be available until later in 2022 *sometime after* the
    initial release of iOS 16.



 It makes sense.  Gotta give the app developers time to learn it and implement it
into their respective apps.  It's a whole new iOS API they gotta learn and
utilize so it'll take some time. 
 


 I hope we’re able to disable those. IDGAF about sports or music details. 
 
     You wouldn’t have a notification for something you dont care about.

 Sad. Was looking forward to this feature 
 


 Will these be interactive or will they be like widgets, but for the Lock Screen?

The “it just works” magic is fading,"The “it just works” magic is fading

I’ve had both Android and apple back and forth for like 15 years. The main
reason that I keep coming back to apple and have been on iPhone for the last 8
or so years is because stuff used to “just work”. Anything new they released was
flawless (nearly) in working as expected. Recently though, I’ve started to
notice a lot of android-esque glitches and it’s super frustrating. I just put my
watch on the charger, and the battery icon is still showing me the AirPods
charging (which are in a totally different room). The other day, while flipping
my phone for a video, it showed me this weird tiny horizontal screen the size of
landscape mode, but in the top right corner. Had to flip it back and forth a few
times before it displayed properly. AirPlay has been super inconsistent, often
requiring disconnect/reconnect and just hoping it works. Even the photos and
music apps keep glitching, the other day my music started playing on its own
after I stopped it and locked the screen. So many weird little bugs keep popping
up and I’m seriously getting tired of it all. I hope they go back to the “it
just works” magic and fix these issues.

 This is correct. iOS works swell but has lost its polish for sure 
 
     Shareholders demand a new release in October every year, polish be damned 

     I was talking to someone who was a long time former employee of apple who left for greener pastures but
    kept in touch with some folks. Their take was that toxicity in the workplace kept driving good talent out
    and less than stellar folks who were willing to stick it out stayed on and got promoted. Some of the
    achievements and quality levels they were cheering a couple years after they left were levels that they
    said they used to get flogged over when they were there.     Their take was that apple was riding on
    reputation but it was all bound to catch up sooner or later.    Glitches or no, a lot of folks also feel
    ""stuck"" in the ecosystem and admittedly being able to communicate with folks with a consistent icloud
    account even if your phone number changes is also a benefit. Like everything else, they will suck as much
    as thr public will allow them to while making money.

     This was an Android issue since it's inception..too many features, lot of different developing teams so
    lot of fragmentation. Now everything mostly just works. With android-esq of iOS it was bound to happen.

     Steve jobs would not let ts fly is all. The longer they go without him the less you can expect them to
    hold his values of delivering functional and finished products

     I  basically got a Google pixel instead of 16 because of all these bugs and oddities. iOS was annoying me
    on my 14 already as time went on, and I didn't see the point in having such a locked down system if itll
    perform like android anyway...

     Yeah I am feeling open to options for the first time in a while

     Yeah the moat is gone. I may switch because *whispers* who really cares?

     Android has also done a good job catching up. At least the flagships.

     iOS should be fairly stable but they keep breaking it.  Searching for app in settings app often result in
    nothing even though the app is there, as an example.  No way to find / edit blocked contacts, which is
    frustrating. So many small things don’t work.



 I've been buying iPhones and MacBooks exclusively since 2009 and I have
definitely noticed this too. It's frustrating. 
 
     Macos still works the same if not better than before (as long as u have up to date equipment) but ios is
    the problem. They have different teams even though they share resources like kernel code, drivers etc

     The last 2 or 3 versions of iOS are fucking killing me.

     Getting rid of the flippy clicky switch for silent or ring and replacing it with a button was a huge
    mistake. Never ever ever in the entire 6 years of having an iPhone have I had a problem with vibrate on
    silent mode. Recently upgraded and missed several calls already because my iPhone doesn’t vibrate on
    silent even though it’s enabled.   Yes I have Apple care, but this has literally never ever happened in
    the history of keeping my phone on silent for 6 years.  I am very sad about this as I love Apple, always
    have. Those multi colored desktops back in the day wooed me and the “just works” iPhone hooked me.

     Me too. Hell, my 2012 MacBook Air is more consistent than my 2nd gen iPhone SE.

     Same only i started with mbp2010, but last year someone asked me to help print something for them on their
    windows machine. And it was definitely not a plug and print like mac has been since 2010..   this was so
    frustrating to me because i have been told for 5years now that windows doesnt need you to install with
    cd/download/driver bullshit. But it still does.. i wouldnt be surprised if just plugging in a keyboard
    gives errors from hell.   Eventhough mac/apple goes a bit slow or is in a regression.. its still better
    working then a regular windows machine..

     The fact that I can’t keep the day & date showing in my menu bar without it randomly disappearing is a
    constant reminder of the declining software quality.

     imo the last true unbelievable stable MacOS was Snow Leopard.  So rock solid for audio recording and video
    editing.

     Lol pcs and android work just as well. You are in a bubble

11d73ffae76c454518ae483a3fc9a10a360223  Yeah had this happen earlier today.
Getting tired of crap like this and can imagine myself moving to Android one day
if it’s going to continue. 
 
     This is precisely the sort of glitches I’m talking about! Very frustrating

     The reason I haven’t moved to Android is my Apple Watch which has become an integral part of my routine
    and habit.

     This is the best glitch we have ever created!  -Tim

     If current day Apple thinks Steve would have let any of this ship (honestly anything past the X) they are
    absolutely insane.   The entire selling point and value prop of the entire product/ecosystem was OP’s
    title “it just works”.   This is just ten steps backwards.

     This has been going on for years and I can’t believe it’s still not fixed

     That’s been happening to me since the iPhone 7+, which was my first iPhone. Amazed it still happens.

     Yup this happens like once a day at this point

     Whoa, I’ve never seen anything like this. That’s a wild UI bug.

     Never experienced anything close to this bad on android. Barely experience ANY glitches on android these
    days.

     I never thought I’d say this but same. Siri is why I hate it so much aside from little annoyances like
    this and the keyboard being the most frustrating thing you’ll use each day

     Steve Jobs would die again if he saw this

     You might want to lower your expectations if you’re expecting different in the android world. I’ve gone
    back and forth since smartphones first came onto the market and as bad as Apple is getting, they’re still
    better than what’s going on in the android world

     Ugh I feel this. I watch a lot of stuff on my phone in my downtime and I have free rotate on for my
    screen. If I try to text while watching something it freaks all the way out and doesn’t like being
    sideways even though being sideways is literally a feature. Then when I switch it back it gets stuck like
    that.

     As someone who never had an iPhone and for some reason this post was in my feed, I'd just like to say what
    the fuck

     Lol this doesn't happen to me and I have a Samsung from 2020

     The grass is always greener. Android is a shit show. The subreddit is nothing but technical support
    requests.   Don’t assume it’ll be super smooth over there. Google is the king of shipping half baked
    solutions.

     I’m curious what iPhone and iPhone OS combination are you using?

     I already been there. Last year I bought a Samsung phone. It had more bugs than iOS. Android itself was
    fine but the apps were terrible. I bought an iPhone 15 after a few months because I just couldn’t live
    with it.

     Moving to android wont solve shit. It’ll just be slightly worse  In any case, that’s what the consumer
    wants or something

     I can't blame you for considering moving to Android but don't expect the grass to be greener. My wife has
    an S22 that's been showing she has 3 unread texts for over a year now. She even deleted all of them just
    to see if she missed something and those three ghost texts remain, forever unread.

     Beware, on Android it’s likely something like this happen consistently for months 😅 I remember Pixel 5 had
    an issue for which the whole notifications share was completely unreadable in dark mode, because of white
    text on white background. It took them like 5 months to fix it  But jokes(?) aside, that it’s
    inconceivable

     If you think you won’t get these kinds of bugs on Android, have i got news for you  edit: holy shit, i
    thought this was r/iphone, not r/android. Why the fuck are you hanging around the iphone sub if you hate
    is so much?

     Have you heard of restarting your phone once in a while? lol usually fixes these bugs



 They keep changing stuff just for the sake of change. 
 
     Apple has stopped worrying about polish and stability for the sake of just having ""new features"" because
    there's hardly any new advancements anymore for modern cell phones. All of these companies would highly
    benefit from stopping releasing new phones every year but we know this isn't happening.

     Re: the photos app  Having the two tabs of all photos and ""recents"" let you switch back and forth between
    your main full camera roll and favorites or another album. It's so weird to navigate now.

     Exactly! What was wrong with the photos app? As a UX designer it frustrates me even more, because its
    obvious they redesigned the app just for the sake of it without an actual problem to solve

     I am still very very very pissed they changed the timer from showing the end time to just show how much
    was set.  GOD DAMN SUCH A USEFUL FEATURE REPLACED BY UTTER GARBAGE JUST BECAUSE.

     Developers have to develop or…whatever happens

     This is true for pretty much every tech company these days. Toast rebranded to ""Local"" and it's annoying
    to remember every time that they rebranded.  Gotta justify every PM/PD salary somehow.

     I’m what is considered old now, I have worked in IT most of my life and the reason I am slower at IT
    things now is I have many dozens of versions of software I have experience with, so it takes time to
    figure out how *this version* does it, or even if it still has that feature.

     What would be amazing would be more areas of customization.

     100% this, by the time i get used to everything a new update comes and it’s completely changed.

     Like the calculator.   Literally took away the repeat operation via hitting “=“ and rendered it 90% more
    useless for me.

     That's the general trend in SW development these days. They don't have any big ideas anymore so people
    need to justify their employment by creating a lot of churn.

     The new photo album is complete ass and was just unnecessary.

     This right here. I wish they didn’t, but the shareholders need their profit. No time for something to
    marinate without another Change or release of something.



 Incoming call, but it won’t let you swipe to answer. Just fantastic when it
fails at being a.. phone. 
 
     every fucking time someone calls me I am swearing because it took 50 swipes to answer, or it answered
    properly but then the screen keeps toggling betwen off and on when I'm trying to put the fucking  all on
    speaker phone.   such a pile of shit.   thankfully apple doesn't want to make small phones anymore so once
    my 13 mini is too old to use, I'll take another almost certainly disappointing wade into android land

     There’s this new bullshit on iOS 18 my iPhone’s been doing where when I answer a call it’ll show that
    popup audio source menu. It used to only show up if you were actively connected to an external audio
    source, but now it shows up every time and “connects” my Beats by default even though they’re powered off.
    So I don’t actually hear any audio until I select “iPhone”. To make this worse, when I actually have my
    Beats on and receive a call, the call audio defaults to iPhone. Absolutely driving me up a god damn wall
    with this nonsense.

     I've had that bug since iOS 1 and I can't believe it's still there today.

     and voicemail has basically never worked... like how do you fuck that up?

     Yup, had that today

     Jfc that happened to me yesterday. Took 5+ tries to accept the call.

     Sometimes you press the screen lock button and it hangs up your call. Sometimes it doesn’t. What gives?



 Took me 5 minutes to disable Apple Intelligence given how shitty the
implementation was. 
 
     I don’t think I even have it yet. With all the negative reviews on it, I’ll just wait till I actually have
    some use for it or it becomes useful organically.

     I think that’s part of the issue. My 13PM has had zero bugs while others with newer iPhones seem to be
    having glitches.

     How do you disable it?

     I like how you can disable it but it’s still taking up 3GB of your storage like wtf? If it’s turned off it
    should all be deleted.

     [deleted]

     Honest question, is Apple Intelligence the first time they have released a product to everyone and called
    it a beta?



 One of Apple’s biggest issues is that the company as a whole has massive ADHD.
The moment they come up with something new to focus on, they abandon fixing any
remaining bugs in their previous hot new thing. 
 
     That’s because that’s how incentive structures work at big tech companies nowadays, in part driven by how
    investors value tech stocks. You only get promoted for the new shiny, the only reason you pay attention to
    anything else is if the bugs or tech debt gets so bad it can’t be ignored.

     I have a cynical theory (which is probably just a fact) that if something is bad, be it a feature of iOS
    or a meal at a restaurant, it’s because somehow it’s more profitable for it to be bad.  They’ve done the
    math that saving costs by sacrificing quality gives them a better margin than the reverse.   This take is
    mostly just the concept of Enshitification I suppose.

     [deleted]

     Like fixing how absolutely terrible auto correct has gotten.

     [*cries in HomeKit*]

     lol I thought that Google was the one doing that constantly

     I feel like I’m living in an alternate reality in this thread.  Surely, even if this is the case, *google*
    is famous for this, not Apple, right?

     trying to figure out an ipad for my partner who wants to use it with a pencil for design, sweet fucking
    christ how is this a real company



 They need an OS release like iOS 12, where the focus is on stability.  But at
this stage they’re too busy chasing the AI train 
 
     I’m so sick of the AI train. Most of that train is technically machine learning anyway.  But I don’t want
    AI nonsense or generated art nonsense.  I just want to be able to do normal things.

     100% This stuff! Never was an issue before



 Oh 100% I work at a carrier and the amount of iPhone 16's we've had to replace
as an Out Of Box failure due to IOS fucking up is insane.  The main issues we've
found are basically that it'll glitch while transferring and the new phone will
get so hot it can't do shit and basically breaks. It's ridiculous.  Also Phone
Transfers on iPhones are horrid compared to Samsung's, Samsung to Samsung you
plug the two phones into each other and that's easy as, iPhones have so so so
many issues for dumb reasons, like the prompt to transfer just doesn't always
show up. Stuff just breaks now. 
 
     Yes! I’ve experienced this when upgrading my dad’s phone. New phone got stuck somewhere in the process
    after like an hour or so of work. Had to figure out how to do a hard reset and start over. Took like 3
    hours total of having both his phones.

     God forbid they have the security delay turned on and forget their password

     I deal with data migration of multiple devices (usually Apple-to-Apple, or Android-to-Android, but cross-
    system migrations are becoming more of a thing of late) and I will happily get 2 Apple migrations done in
    the time of a single Android one. Usually.  And I tend to have FAR more reliable results and processes
    with the Apple stuff.  But that's just me.

     YES! I had to replace my new 16 because it didn’t transfer 100% and then it stopped charging. It was so
    odd.

     Android to Android used to be absolutely terrible. Glad to hear it’s a little better now

"
I think something is wrong with the Apple Smart battery case. I had to replace it multiple times,"I think something is wrong with the Apple Smart battery case. I had to replace it multiple times

Something is wrong with the design of the smart battery case. After using it at
first, it worked and then gradually it stops charging the phone.   The reason is
because you have to push down on the case to make the port go in. Otherwise it’s
too loose and won’t charge even when your phone is in the case.   I went to the
Apple Store and when I talked about this issue, the guy told me a lot of people
have come back for that.   I had to replace my smart battery case TWO times in
less than 6 months.

 I went through 4 replacements. Apple ended up just giving me a gift card for
another case.

    has addressed publicly.   They will replace it for you under the one year warranty. I’ve already replaced
    it twice lol. This is my third one. Hopefully I just got unlucky twice but we will see.

     I had one on my 7 for almost two years and it worked perfectly fine. I’ve had one on my XS since the case
    was released and it’s been working perfectly fine as well. If and when they release a case for the 2020
    iPhone, I won’t hesitate to get that one either.

     Can I ask you what your use case is for your phone that you routinely run out of charge during the day? I
    honestly can't remember the last time I've run out. It's been years. Hell even when i play games on my
    phone throughout the day, which runs at 90hz, it doesn't die before I go to bed. How are you guys even
    using so much battery?

     I’ve had the Smart Battery Case for my Xs Max since May and it’s worked brilliantly for me. Hopefully I
    don’t have to eat these words but it may just affect some units not all.



 I just get a seperate portable brick, and if you have the iPhone 11 pro max it
wouldn't be too much of a problem (unless you're into 2+ day use) 
 
     I don’t think they did the battery pack for the new phones quite yet.



 Same. I’m just getting my second replacement now. Bought original in Feb, got
replaced in May, now having to replace again. 
 
     Finally a kindred spirit!!



 Mine has been doing that too. I can push the phone up with my thumbs with little
force and cause it to stop charging. Pushing it down into the lightning plug
makes it charge again  I thought my case was just faulty, but maybe it’s a more
widespread issue than I thought  Would you suggest I go in and ask for a
replacement? 
 
     Always.   This way apple aslo has a reason and motivation to improve the design. Imagine if everyone with
    a butterfly keyboard had gone in for replacements - they would have had to address the issue and fast!!

     Definitely!! It’s a manufacturer’s defect.   I’ve been searching online to see if anyone has these issues
    but I haven’t seen any so that’s why I created this post to see if there are more people who have this
    problem.



 Hmm. I had a black smart battery case for my previous iPhone XS Max. Never had
an issue.   Not to say that you’re not experiencing issues. But just wanted to
provide a data point.   Maybe the XS max version had better tolerances than the
non-max version. 
 
     My experience has been similar to yours.



 I literally scheduled an appointment for tomorrow earlier this week. I’ve had my
battery case almost since I got my Xs max last year with zero issues until the
last week or so. It keeps connecting/disconnecting all the time randomly. I
can’t get it to repeat consistently. Never drop my phone. I don’t keep it in my
back pocket. No idea why it’s happening out of nowhere but it seems to be a very
common problem. I’m worried my replacement will be worse now... 
 
     Yes I’ve had the same issue where it sometimes charges and sometimes doesn’t, leaving me with a case
    that’s fully charged and my phone at 40%.   Just get your replacement ASAP before warranty runs out

     Can confirm. This issue was happening on mine too.



 Happens to mine as well. I put in a small piece of paper at the top and since
then it has been working.  Maybe I should get it replaced before my warranty
runs out.... 
 
     Yeah you shouldn’t have to resort to such a bootleg solution when it’s an Apple product. We pay the
    premium because it should “just work”, not “kind of work”



 I have just received my 4th battery case replacement. There’s is definitely an
issue with this case entirely 
 
     You’ve received 4 cases under a 1 year warranty ?



 There is absolutely something wrong with it. I had to trade my in 3 times and on
the 3rd one I just gave up. It’s sitting in a drawer as a reminder to **never**
again by a smart battery case from Apple.      Honestly at this point, they need
to issue a recall. 
 
     I feel so validated ! I was going crazy thinking it was just me  You should just get a refund

My brother did this. What do I do?,"My brother did this. What do I do?

He's 10. And my dad gave him his Iphone 7 Plus. He for some reason transferred
the apple id from his Ipad to the phone, and he doesn't have the app store, I i
checked the screen time, and it required a passcode. The thing is nobody knows
the passcode and we tried every single code we thought it would be. He wants to
sign out or factory reset the Iphone, but that also requires the screen time
pascode. We don't have a mac so idk if that will work. Anyone tips? Ty

     Real

     😂  My first response was ""Smack your brother""  But then reading her post about what happened to her phone
    makes me think wtf did brother do to the phone? Did he possibly click malicious text w/o realizing?

     [removed]

     Not joking thought post said brother died and left the phone like that… your comment and the responses
    shocked me to say the least

     This

     agree

     ""Dad, doesn't mom look gorgeous today?""

     lol.Although it may seem absurd, it is correct.

     You have whole hour to burn until you can try again! In sure you could find a brother in that time.

     💀

     Vamos Argentina!!!

     Plot twist: this is his girlfriends phone



 UPDATE: With the help of you guys, I restored it and unlocked it with previous
passcode. This time I made sure I set it up instead of him. ty yall ❤️ 
 
     Can you share the specific steps you took to get it done?

     Now kick your brother in the throat

     Happy it worked for you!

     Try again in 60 minutes

     Just to be safe you should perform a reset on your brother also.

     So do you still have a brother?

     How did you get a new brother so quick!?

     Wait your 10 year old brother set up your dads phone before? lol

     Congrats!

     The next step is to throw your brother in the garbage

     You can set to erase after 10 failed attempts so if it happens again you can just restore after

     I hope you told your parents that they should have used protection 10 months before your brother was born.
    J/K. Jokes aside, someone did that to me at work, I kicked him in the extremities and got fired at work.
    Worth it.

     I was going to say I recommend waiting 60 minutes but nevermind glad you got it :)

     The good ending 🔥

     Stay safe man 💙✨

     Hopefully, this will be a good lesson to the 10 year old

     Huzzah!



 Log into your iCloud from another Apple device. Find your device on ‘Find my
iPhone’, remote wipe it.  Then do the restore process with your iCloud and reset
up with whatever PW you want. You WILL have to input your existing iCloud PW to
restore the remote wiped device tho. 
 
     You can just change the screen time passcode from the parent account. I’ve had to do it a hundred times

 You can still put it in DFU mode and plug it into a windows machine but will
need the iCloud passcode to reset it 
 
     How do I get it in DFU mode?



 Plug it into a pc with iTunes or a Mac in the finder and just restore it. It’ll
ask for the iCloud password but I think it’s safe to assume he knows it since he
logged in. I believe restore mode on the 7/8/SE phones is hold down power button
and volume up until it restarts, then once the Apple logo comes up release power
but keep on the volume button. I could be wrong on that it’s been a while
personally but a PC icon should pop up, then plug it into the computer and
iTunes/finder will say “iPhone has a problem and needs restored” or something
along those lines and just hit restore. At the end it will ask for the iCloud
password like said previously but then your good. You have to put it in restore
mode or DFU mode (the same kinda but more steps) or else it will require the
screen time code to restore. 
 


 Unable to reset with Apple ID password?

Apple should allow to you tap an icon on your lock screen to retry Face ID,"Apple should allow to you tap an icon on your lock screen to retry Face ID

Maybe I'm just doing it wrong but I get extremely frustrated when I get a
notification on my iPhone X but Face ID either doesn't realize I'm looking at
the phone or it tried reading my face before I was fully looking at the screen.
This usually leads to me turning the screen off and back on again (which is
super slow) in order to try and get it to read my face again or I end up just
having to enter my PIN.  I think it would be a nice feature if you could tap
somewhere on the screen to allow it to try again and thus saving me time and
frustration.   Anyone else have this problem?  Edit: ffs how did I miss the typo
in my title?

 Or if it would keep trying to scan while you're inputting the passcode. Either
would work for me. 
 
     That would be perfectly okay with me as well.

     I think it does that, many times I’m one or two numbers into typing it and it unlocks

     This is a bad idea. FaceID uses successful and unsuccessful logins as new training data for their NN. If
    it just keeps on scanning over and over, you're just stuffing the network with negative classification
    examples. And often, the reason it's failing is not necessarily something you want it to train it as a
    failure (i.e. maybe your phone was just not at the right angle). It makes sense for them to be a bit more
    deliberate with how they accept in retries in input.

     How about if you didn't have to select ""use passcode""? I cant stand when my phone is sitting on my desk.
    It takes for ever to unlock.

     It already does that.

     There’s some kind of security case going on here but I’m not sure I could do justice by detailing what’s
    happening and why in the three try scenario.

     Then might as well opt for having apple keep touch ID



 It asks you to enter your PIN because that authenticates that it really is you,
and then it will use the data from the failed scan to adjust it's neural network
to better recognize you for the next scan.  It should get more and more accurate
every time this happens and ask for your PIN less and less often. 
 
     Yes I’ve had my X since February and it’s unlocking more frequently now with just Face ID. It still won’t
    unlock with my furry hood up, though.

     that's smart as fuck

     [deleted]



 If you swipe down on the home bar (like invoking reachability), the phone will
re-scan your face. Or you can tilt the phone back and forwards again 
 
     I always feel like I have a hard time swiping down on that bar. Like I swipe slightly above the bar and it
    pulls the screen down. You have I just nip the edge. Am I doing it wrong?

     Why doesn't this have more upvotes? It's actually the answer we needed.

     [deleted]



 I do occasionally have this problem, but if you find that the phone doesn’t
recognize you, tilt it back (away from you) and then tilt it back (facing you)
and it should retry the face recognition. 
 
     Yeah I’ve done that as well but even then sometimes it is just stubborn and doesn’t want to give me a
    second chance.

     But this is you learning how to work around the inadequacies of the software-- they should just add an
    option.

     Mind blown. Thank you for that tip.

     Doesn’t that only work if you have raise to wake turned on?

     I came here to say that, works most of the time for me.



 I find that if it fails to read the first time, if I swipe from the bottom of
the screen again, it would re-invoke FaceID. 
 
     I've seen this suggestion below but can't try this. Swiping from bottom once it wants the passcode does
    nothing for me.



 I completely agree, and actually posted basically this exact same thing the
other day, haha. I would prefer to be able to tap the lock to rescan over or
rescanning while I’m typing in my PIN because sometimes I want it to unlock but
not *open* because I just want to read the text notifications to see if I need
to respond to any right now. 
 


 Yes! Happens to me all the time, plus id like an immediate bypass.  For those of
us that use a cpap mask in bed,  it will never learn to see my face in darth
vader mode. 
 


 Speaking of this and the iPhone X  Been using iPhones for like 8 years now and
this one is by far the worst. Hang ups, random shut downs, trouble I've never
had with any other iPhone on the ""best iPhone ever made""  Unlike every other
iteration I've ever used it just doesn't have the ""just works"" factor. 
 
     But don’t you just love what they did to the Music and Messages apps? Omg lol rofl tgif 🤘💰🤗👍



 I've had my iPhone X since launch day.  When I'm actively unlocking with Face
ID, my failure rate has been below 5% for the past two or three months.  It
works incredibly well.  To re-invoke Face ID, you only need to activate Raise to
Wake again  or swipe down on the Home Indicator. 
 


 I pull the home bar up a little, and then back down

"I bought an iPhone 16, and I have absolutely 0 « wow » effect.","I bought an iPhone 16, and I have absolutely 0 « wow » effect.

I’m a long time iPhone user.   - my first iPhone was an iPhone 3GS.  - then, I
bought an iPhone 4. The feeling was awesome. It looked like the future in his
time.  - he randomly died when iPhone 6s was already out, but I bought the 6
(cheaper). Then again, amazing feeling. Bigger but not too much. Thin, light.
Touch ID. Wow.  - the 6 slowly became unusable. I bought a brand new iPhone Xr.
This time again, the wow effect was there. Face ID instead of touch ID. The size
which is (IMO) perfect for a phone. All screen and almost no edge. Wow.  Here I
am now. My iPhone Xr still almost works like it’s brand new. Battery is at 88%
after all these years. I just bought an iPhone 16 for better photography, iPhone
Xr being very limited on that side.  But appart of photography ? Absolutely no
excitation. Absolutely no wow effect. Absolutely nothing.  Apple intelligence ?
Is a piece of sh*t and couldn’t care less about it anyway. Haven’t even
activated it and just wish apple will allow us to delete the space it takes on
the phone.  iOS future MaJ ? Well if Apple could release an update without bug
and with the se attention to details than before, I would care about it. That’s
not the case anymore.  Dynamic island ? Absolutely useless compared to the
notch.  Hardware ? Hardware specs are already enoght for common use since years.
It really makes me realise there is no evolution anymore about iPhone. The 16 is
basically an Xr with better photo lenses.  I can see that when I watch keynote.
« best ever this », « best ever that », « amazing », blablabla… But on a daily
basis ? For John Doe use ? Nothing.  I don’t know if Apple is not able to
innovate anymore. I don’t know if smartphone has just peaked in terms of shape
and performance for normal people. What I know is that I see absolutely no
reason to spend so much money in it to change it if it wasn’t for planned
obsolescence or failure. Here I am with my new phone, and I’m just glad I was
able to have it for a good price.

 You are far from the first to make this observation. At this point, replacing a
phone or computer is basically more of an inconvenience than anything else.
The days of anxiously awaiting the release of a new device are gone. I’ve not
seen anything to get excited about in probably 6-7 years. 
 
     Best new tech I got in the last year was the Bose Open Ultra earbuds. Felt like the same magic I had when
    I got AirPods for the first time or an iPad.  Being able to listen to good sounding music without my ears
    being blocked still trips me up to this day.

     Having lived through the widespread adoption of the internet and cell phones, it feels weird that advances
    in consumer tech have stalled like this. AI seems like the thing everyone’s anticipating—but no one seems
    to even like it. And most of the predictions about what AI will look like seem to be either completely
    underwhelming, or just a total jobless hellscape (no in-between).   The good news is we can do something
    about shitty corporate policies, especially when they’re being carried out by monopolies. We should break
    up Google, but we should also break up Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. And we should adequately fund
    basic research through federal grants and the university system—because that’s where technological
    advances come from.

     The Steam Deck I think was pretty great

     Thank you I’ve been saying this forever. Phones have gotten to the point where they are so good the phone
    wars and people hating that someone got the thing you don’t like doesn’t matter. l

     The wife just got herself brand new Samsung flagship and it’s been 2 months and she hasn’t changed her
    phone yet cos it’s so cumbersome. I’m still trying to justify getting a new iPhone over my se3.

     Hold up. I just got a new computer and it’s super exciting. Sometimes I just stare at it.  (Went from a
    2016 MacBook Air to a m2 MacBook Air)

     Wait wait wait. Have you NOT see the new *checks notes* camera bump on the iPhone 17?! That's going to be
    amazing and You're Going to Love It™️

     To each their own. I was excited going from my 13 Pro to my 16 Pro. Not like “omg I can’t wait” of course
    — but still…  It’s small, quality of life, things for me:   - The titanium body is noticeably lighter in
    weight and I like the more rounded edges - The camera button is the way I always wanted to open the camera
    (coming from Pixels before my 13) - The cameras are better across the board (albeit marginally), and the
    5x zoom is very welcomed - I like action button for turning on my flashlight (silent mode moves to the
    lock screen) - Love always on display - I like the visuals of the Dynamic Island (unlocking, now playing,
    etc), even if I haven’t really found it functionally groundbreaking yet   I realize that most of these are
    Pro features, and I do still understand why most people aren’t chomping at the bit for the latest and
    greatest — but I’ve been happy with the upgrade so far.

     Glad; but not surprised, that this comment has been made. The R&D has pretty much been done. Apple said as
    much when they introduced the “final form of iPhone” with the X, stopped reporting iPhone sales figures,
    and went in HARD on min-maxing logistics and went all in on the services that come WITH the purchase of
    iPhone & other ecosystem enforcing products.    If you want novelty, samsung sells a $3000 bendy phone
    with midrange performance, lousy cameras that can’t be left near water or dust (and other compromises)

     My Oppo find N5 sparks the excitement that you refer to

     Android users;🤔

     Tbh I think the 14 pro max was a wow phone for me

     13 series was the last time I was excited about any phone release form any company, and that was only
    excitement for 120hz on an iPhone lol

     What model do you think the iphone peaked at?

     Speak for yourself. I love every single CPU and GPU upgrade I make every generation.

     Idk about the computer part. Depends on what you do with a computer, is it for work flow, gaming, editing,
    ai training, or all of that. iPhones and phones in general though? Most people use them as just a phone
    and for networking so I’d say apart from camera improvements and battery life it’s been pretty much
    gimmicks since 2015.

     Have you seen the GPD Win Max 2025? Being an iPhone and Mac user, this machine is the absolute perfection
    for my needs, so much I think I'm gonna sell my Mac soon. It definitely has the WOW effect.

     Agree. And agree with OP. Pretty sad right? You used to get excited about the next iPhone because it WOULD
    have something cool. I think the IPhone X was the last real innovative one. I got the 14 Pro and I like it
    but in terms of big change and wow factor I think IPhone X was the last.  If only Apple could stay as
    innovative. Now they focus on making “slimmest phone/watch” ever. Like I don’t care. I want to spend this
    hard earned money on something that makes a DIFFERENCE.  They seemed to miss this from their motto “think
    differently”.  Now it’s stay the same, slowly iterate.

     I’d say the days of anxiously awaiting a release have been gone since the iPhone 6. I got slightly excited
    for the X but since it’s just been “oh hey another year a new iPhone … ehh it’s not doing much that I
    can’t already do”. I picked up an iPhone 12 for 200$ a couple months back and it’s been the upgrade to my
    X. I like it but I won’t be upgrading to anything else for a very long time

     This thing about launching cell phones every year too. I buy my iPhone every 2 or 3 years because there is
    almost no difference between them

     I really don’t agree with computers but phones yeah sure

     ""...replacing a phone or computer is basically more of an inconvenience than anything else""    Nailed it.
    And I'd say it's both as inconvenient and exciting as getting new tires on your car. Nothing else is
    different and the thing still drives more or less the same.

     Maybe you’re right.  I’m not interested at all in foldable phones. One thing that interest me is the DeX
    (by Samsung I believe). A phone being a computer while connected to a computer screen. But I doubt
    companies would like to develop this, especially Apple. The computers sales would fall dramatically.

     Switching to Pixel 9 from iPhone 13 was the first time in a decade that I felt the ""Wow"" factor from a
    phone.  Phone App  * Call Screening  * Hold for Me  Google Photos & Camera   * Magic Eraser  * Photo

 The iPhone is a properly established product, as is the smart phone more
generally. Right now, there's not a lot to innovate on - they're just iterating.
Not defending Apple or anyone, just saying it's probably an area we'll see
little, big breakthroughs in for the foreseeable without another big shakeup. 
 
     I’ve always considered myself a techie and would be excited to see the next phone.   But now I’m at the
    stage where I’m sticking with my 14 Pro because it’s purple 🤷

     Yea the phones do everything we need.   And I’m happy apple is smart enough to let a winner be a winner,
    unlike new cars which seem to jump on any marketing gimmick.    A bigger battery seems to be the only
    obvious improvement that would be welcomed, then maybe more storage and better camera.  Rest of it is
    fine.  People gotta nit pick pretty deep to find flaws with it, which means it is really capable

     I would like to see a foldable where you won’t notice the fold itself when opened.

     I def agree, Im not sure if it's time for something new or IDK. But I think the iPhone itself is pretty
    much fully developed.  Besides refining what's already there; making it bigger/smaller, better battery,
    camera, screen, theres not much to be done and it's just repackaging the product every year. Given it is a
    great product.

     Agreed. There sorta just… isn’t much to be exciting. We already did the bonkers screen, amazing camera,
    long battery life, tons of storage, insanely powerful processor, face id, where do they go next? Aside
    from just adding on pointless gimmicks like sliding pop out cameras just for the sake of having something
    new to advertise there really isn’t much to do

     It’s funny you say we can’t expect breakthroughs… I saw a leak that shows they’re planning to MAKE THE
    CAMERA BUMP BIGGER! This will totally disrupt the industry if they can pull it off.

     I'd be happy if they just tweaked stuff for the better.  Like a proper app drawer, make modifying your
    home screens way more easy, not dictating so many things that should be customer choice.

     Rabbit? Humane pin? 😜

     That’s what I was thinking when reading seeing the different iPhones they’ve had. Each one had a pretty
    big jump in technology. Seems like we’ve hit a bit of a ceiling with the technology, so there wasn’t much
    of a difference between the XR and 16.

     > Right now, there's not a lot to innovate on  Just because no one has found it doesn’t mean there is
    nothing to innovate on. 

     I evaluate tech for real-world usage, and the iPhone still has not passed accessibility for a large scale.
    iPhone’s court-mandated accessibility mode is truncated, limiting access to nearly everything a working
    professional needs. “Just iterating” ignores foldables, frame-rate boosts, and actual hands-free UX—areas
    Apple lags in.   There’s plenty left to innovate, their customers are complacent and do not complain, or
    when something changes every customer over 65 and under 21 complains. They’ve essentially made it
    impossible to innovate because they have not innovated in a while.

     There are still software issues worth spending resources on. They can, for example, innovate to improve
    their horrible keyboard or implement a universal back gesture.



 Tbh I just look at everyday quality of life improvement I.e. Battery life,
brightness, temps, and other factors before diving into 'features'. Upgrading
from a 14, the 16 has better temps so higher sustained brightness and better
battery. Phones in my humble opinion should improve on their core essentials
before improving on gimmicks. Apple intelligence is meh I mainly use copilot
with my 365 subscription which imo is worth it. 
 


 I'm curious to know how a notch is more useful than Dynamic Island. 
 
     Thank you! I thought I was the only person that scratched their head at that part. That’s pure nonsense
    😂😂😂

     I feel like all the posters nitpicking on their phone upgrades are either trolling or have other issues
    going on in their lives.

     I prefer the notch for one reason, you don’t have to reach as high on the screen to pull down notification
    center with a 14/ 16e

     I hated the notch, the dynamic island was my favourite thing about upgrading.

     I feel the dynamic island is more intrusive to the overall screen than a simple notch.

     The island is useless...Like, it offers nothing to me aside having pretty animations but that's all about
    it. Yeah, there's the convenient of having some ""access"" to certain apps but honestly that's only useful y
    you have a small model.



 Seems like you do not need the newest phone. A 13 mini would be great for you as
well. 
 
     Love my mini.

     Yeah as someone who went from an 11 to a 16 - it felt like the jump it used to be for me. Way lighter,
    better design and feel, much improved camera, insane battery life compared to before, etc.

     I just bought a red one and going to be using my 13 pm as back up.

     Would be great for a year or two, until it doesn't update anymore.   Best to do the opposite like OP is
    doing, buy the newest model (or one year old if you prefer to buy used/refurbished and save some money)
    and keep it for multiple years.



 Last wow effect was the iPhone X. 
 
     The iphone x in the hand feels like a more modern phone then the current iphones



 As someone who went from a 6S to a SE2020. the jump to a 15 felt *nice*.
looking at specs though, I gotta agree with your assessment. idk how going from
an Xr to anything newer has too much of a jump.   I will say, personally i like
the dynamic island, i never much liked the idea of the notch, and find myself
using the island a lot for music control.  but idk how it directly compares to a
notch 
 
     I went to an old 3GS to 5S then a SE2020, but it recently broke (motherboard defect) and I'm undecided
    between the iPhone 14 (because I want a red product) and an iPhone 16 (or 16e), but the prices are very
    expensive and I'm also in doubt about the 14 because it's been out for 3 years already (fear of not
    receiving update) I usually keep an iphone for 4\~5 years mostly (or more).



 People‘s expectations are just crazy.. of course a square screen with speakers
will be pretty much perfected after 16 years of top notch engineering work going
into it. 
 
     > top notch  Hehe. Get it?

     I think people are expecting more for the money. Outside of the US iPhones have gotten considerably more
    expensive and you are starting to see people not being happy with the price to value ratio. 



 Why are people buying a new iPhone for “wow effect?” Apple won’t innovate your
phone to be wow. Grab an android. Apple wants everything better for the internal
components rather than the layout of the phone. I had 11 pro max since 2019. I’m
blown away by my 16 pro max. Phone hella fast and hella smooth. Battery life is
fucking amazing. 95% of the layout , apps and icons are the same as my 11 pro
max. But I already knew that BEFORE getting the 16 pro max. I purchased the 16
for satellite text , Genmoji and more important the BATTERY LIFE. 
 


 I don’t know if you were just more impressed by stuff that was less impressive,
or you’re just expecting too much now.   I don’t know that I understand how
incorporating the dynamic island with features is more useless than the notch
that literally did nothing in the ui and was just there housing components… but
sure.   It’s a phone. You don’t need to think about it too much.

Why does my child’s phone say it’s going to be removed?,"Why does my child’s phone say it’s going to be removed?

I have a troubled teen who is currently on lock down for his choices in life. He
has his phone but everything is restricted except for contact with specific
family members, counselors, and a couple of other important people.   This
morning I got a notification that a new apple product was connecting to my WiFi.
There were 2 log ins for iPhone 11’s which were disconnected within the past 20
minutes.   I’m not getting anything for data on screen time restrictions and I
found that his iPhone says it’s going to be removed from my family account next
month.  Can anyone tell me what is going on here? Asking him is pointless and
I’m honestly not up for fighting with him for the phone.

 He was somehow able to deactivate his child apple ID + parental controls 
 
     Yeah. I just confirmed that. He has a new Apple ID on his phone but some how it is still locked down and
    he can’t access most of it.

     [removed]

     Let him keep those off. He’s a human. Too often, parental controls are meant to be a way to not teach
    their kids, allowing tech to do it instead.

     You’re such an opp

     Fed👀

     Why would you snitch on him



 He probably DFU wiped it and set up a new Apple ID. 
 
     If he knows the password to the Apple ID then yes this probably happened

     Can he do this without a Mac computer? Only computer he has access to is his schools chrome book



 I’m sure this is no help at all, but I was the exact same way as a teen and into
my 20’s. I gave my parents absolute hell and they paid for legal fees and all
kinds of shit for me. I grew up, I’m 30 now and just bought a house with the
love of my life. I apologize to my mom frequently for the crap that I put her
through. Dad passed so I can only live in a way that would make him proud if he
was still here. I hope your teen has a moment of awakening as I did. I’m still a
little shit but not in any ways that would ever cause harm or trouble. lol 
 
     Damn I’m happy to hear that you turned out a better person, also love that you still apologize to your mom
    for the things you did, that’s super sweet

     He’d for sure be proud

     howd u fix urself if u dont mind me askin?

     Ok



 I have read all comments. I know you are not answering back. Just wanted to show
my support in these hardtimes for you. Hope it gets better. 
 


 At this point, get him a flip phone. It’s what my mom did for my sister when she
wasn’t doing great, and my mom still holds onto it in case she decides not to
behave well again 
 
     My dad did this with my brother as well. Bought him a £20 Alcatel when he was being a shit and I remember
    his iPhone being confiscated and replaced with it at least twice. Funniest shit.

     repeating the same punishment, especially when its taking away devices, is counterproductive and will make
    teenagers more spiteful, js. they’re gonna find a way to use the internet anyways.

     Good advice from Father

     Arlecchino jumpscare.

     Least obvious arlecchino fan

     I got a old phone, but found out my 3ds had unlimited internet acces. After they figured it out, the wifi
    got disabled at certain times. So I got the neighbors wifi

     Bingo. Flip phones are a great compromise; particularly in this case, when the parent will no longer be
    providing access to a data plan. Flip phones still give you the ability to text and call. A laptop or
    tablet for home can provide internet access for home or school then.   Looks like a number of good, solid
    reasons for limiting smart phone use were provided by OP. Putting limits isn’t always “bad”. Kids and
    teens do not have the brain development needed to make certain decisions about safety, and guidance is
    sometimes needed to help them do so.

     I did this to my daughter several times while she was in high school. Make stupid decisions, win stupid
    prizes.



 I appreciate all the comments. Since I have gotten the original information I
was looking for I am going to stop replying to comments at this point. I
understand that there are a vast number of options on why my child did this. I
am not in the space to sit and defend my actions or debate about my parenting
choices. 
 
     Just wanted to wish you and your family the best of luck, and I hope you're getting support for yourself
    as well. This can be emotionally exhausting, so try to remember to take care of yourself too, and carve
    out time to spend focused on your younger child. A troubled teen can end up sucking up all the energy in a
    household, and that's not fair to you or anyone else.

     I’m sorry people were more interested in invading your personal life than they were trying to help you   I
    wish the best for you and your family :)

     You’re doing great, mom/dad. My kids are young, but I’m already dreading teenage years. You’re working
    hard with you were dealt, and through all your comments I hear love. Don’t let internet strangers get you
    down. You’re doing the best you can.

     I have nothing helpful to add on your OP.  But, I wanted to send you love and light right now.  I’m so
    sorry you’re going through all of this.

     Wishing you well

     Thank you for not giving up on him.  He sounds  a lot like my brother, who now has a beautiful family and
    has made a career doing this ethically and legally

     You’re a good parent that knows what’s best for their child. It’s hard on the internet because everyone
    thinks they know how to be a parent better than other people and it’s exhausting. Keep your head up, and
    don’t give up. ❤️

     take the whole phone away then



 You need your lock down your network.  Configure it to only allow specific MAC
addresses.  Then, he can’t add an additional device.  If his new phone has
cellular, then he can still bypass your restrictions. 
 
     would not work in this case. the kid just reset the phone and made a new apple id.  the MAC adress is
    still the same as it's hardware bound.   so all that would help is changing the wifi password to something
    complex.  like AbC123#$%. make sure to use capitals and special characters and mix and match.  because if
    he's smart to figure out how to reset the phone  with DFU to bypass restrictions. then he's also smart
    enough to google and  run a simple wifi password cracking utility (i would know because i was the exact
    same but at 13 years old)

     I have no clue how to do any of that. I grew up with computers but when I was learning about them they
    were still using DOS and the original windows.    I did change the password on my network and paused the
    connection to all of his devices that were listed.

     There are ways around that. That’s what my mom did for our network when I was a teenager. I just learned
    how to spoof my MAC address, and copied down the one from her iPad when she wasn’t looking

     MAC address authentication is very poor practise in corporate IT. I use it only for very-low-stakes
    things, such as preventing users from accidentally connecting from a network with limited LAN access.   It
    is really easy to spoof MAC addresses. I would say that in this situation I recommend using a SSO system
    for wifi access. I have this set up at my home, although this is rather overkill and complex for such a
    situation.

     That's pain in the ass if you buy anything new for a house that uses internet



 Take the phone away and get him a dumb phone for texting/calls.   It seems he is
trying to get around the restrictions. 
 
     Dude its a fucking child of course just let him do him



 I don’t know if this will get buried or not but I’m going to explain a few
things here.  1: I cannot legally take the phone away from him. It belongs to
him. I do pay for the service but I cannot cut that off either. I am not allowed
to cut off his contact with a list of specific people.  2: A flip phone will not
work in this situation. He won’t carry one and I use his phone location to track
him. I don’t push this because I’d rather have the location date for his safety
than for him to go awol with no phone.  3: I asked a simple question about the
screenshot provided. I know nothing about iPhones since I am new to them  4: The
parenting advice is really unnecessary. I have chosen to remain vague on a
variety of things to protect the children and myself.  The people that need to
know what is happening in my kid’s life have been informed. I am not a perfect
parent and I am doing the absolves that I can with the situation at hand. 
 
     Just a couple follow ups:   1) Does your son require internet access to contact that list of people. If he
    does not need internet, call 611 from his phone (or your phone if you share a provider) and ask them to
    block data. You may need to escalate to a supervisor/retention, but this is something they should be able
    to do for you.  2) If you do number 1 above, Find My iPhone still works with internet/cellular disabled,
    as long as nearby iPhones are connected.   If you own a business (you need a DUNS number) enroll in [apple
    business manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/sign-up-axm402206497/web), and
    [supervise his iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-
    us/102291#:~:text=If%20you're%20an%20administrator,the%20devices%20that%20they%20own) . This will allow
    you to use software like [JAMF Now](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-now/) to manage his device. You can
    use JAMF without supervision, however without supervision the software can be removed. With this you also
    get the benefit of remote management lock, which is much harder to remove then Activation lock. You can
    also have both activation and remote management lock.  There is software that you can install on both your
    router his iPhone to manage internet access when connected to Wi-Fi. I use
    [https://nextdns.io/](https://nextdns.io/) to manage my parent's devices (mainly for the ad-block
    functionality). Other software that is available is [https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-
    security/](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) . A couple important limitations: No filter is
    perfect, and network/DNS based filtering (like I recommended) is more vulnerable to bypass. I am only
    recommending it cause it sounds like your son would be savvy enough to get around any on-device
    restrictions. Also, If you only install it on your son's iPhone (and it is un-supervised) he can remove
    the app/configuration pretty easily. The app does support having different settings for different devices,
    and can easily be installed on your router, so I would set the most restrictive settings possible on your
    there, and then creating less restrictive profiles for your devices. This way you have restricted internet
    access to everything except on your devices.

     Bro… what is going on? I’m sorry for whatever is happening, but I wish you the best. I can’t give you any
    parental advice, however I can inform you that you can go to your routers settings and block any ip you
    want from being accessed within your network (if you didn’t know this already)  Edit: I thought the
    investigations were for the 6 year old, I was so confused. You’re right, blocking websites won’t do
    anything, neither will a therapist (unless he goes with his own will). I think you should ask for advice
    from someone who specialises in that stuff, and try to help him your self.

     How bout giving him an apple watch with sim. And a flip phone

     What do you mean “legally belongs to him”?  And why can you not cut off certain services, or block certain
    numbers and websites?   Have there been a bunch of new laws passed recently? You are the account owner.
    Your children are minors. You are their legal guardian. I am genuinely curious about any new law passed
    that might prevent you from having control over their devices

     Just a bit of reassurance:  #You’re doing fine.   Keep up the care & dedication for your family. ✌🏼

     Bro what?  1. Yes, you absolutely can, or you stop paying for service.   2. That shouldn’t matter, because
    he shouldn’t be able to *leave the house*.  No wonder this kid is fucked, you refuse to parent him 

     If you’re in America and he’s a minor you can legally take the phone whether it’s his or not. Children
    basically have no rights. Doesn’t matter if he paid for it, if it’s in his name, nothing. You can take it



 might need a router that has built in child limitation tools. most new ones have
them built in.

Well... crap.,"Well... crap.

Long time iphone user since 2015 (6, 6s+, 11, 15) and have never had a phone
break in any way. Currently using a 15 with Verizon and I'm also a LEO. A week
ago I ended up fighting a suspect and we both fell to the ground, on the same
left side where my phone was in my cargo pocket. Screen is fine and didn't think
anything happened to it. Today I took the case off to clean the phone... and
sure enough my phone is actually bent. Screen and back glass intact and
everything seems to be working just fine.  Unfortunately I didn't get the
Verizon phone insurance and don't have Applecare other than the 1 year limited
warranty. I don't have access to a replacement chassis or the tech know-how to
fix it. Dunno if I should just roll with it or see if Apple can fix it for a fee
without me being screwed since this is on a monthly payment upgrade from my 11.

 Just pretend you have a curved display when watching videos horizontally 
 
     With the small display and viewing distance he could be getting a better curved experience vertically.

     It's not a bug. It's a feature.

     Damn apples stealing from Samsung again

     💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣

     💀🗿

     I bet you still think insurance is scam right? 😜

     On its way to becoming Apple's first folding phone!

     Unrelated. But gave me a chuckle after a long day at work. Thank you!

    just use LEO.

     Bruh, I was thinking about the exact same joke but figured most people here would know exactly what LEO
    (as opposed to the uncapitalized version) would mean so I didn’t expect anyone to think of the same joke.
    Glad I’m not the only one with this type of thinking!

     I’m a Leo as well and it happened to my phone. I didn’t not fall and didn’t even have a phone. Just one
    day i saw there was a phone and it was bent. I’m typing from it right now. Very grateful for being a Leo.
    Edit: Also let me know if someone is missing a bent iPhone.

     typical taurus

     lol. LEO - law enforcement officer



 You see those Apple users from Hammerfell? 
 
     They got curved phones. Curved. Phones!

     damn bro. here have my upvote.



 Can you get it replaced through work? “My personal property was damaged in the
line of duty / due to job-related events” or something. 
 
     I'll have to ask my sergeant about that. Didn't think about that. I'm currently on workers comp for a knee
    injury during that same incident.

     Highly doubt that. I’m in LE also and I talked to one of our troopers in the area and NOTHING personal is
    covered. Only what’s issued to you is.



 I had a cousin who was a cop but they actually had a second cheap android phone
they used when they were at work. They kept their really good and expensive
phone at home and just used it when they were off duty. They probably broke
three of the spare phones over the course of several years. But that kind of a
job you really do need Applecare+ 
 
     Yeah that's weird, id rather have ac+ than a cheap work phone. Unless there's other reasons...🫣

     Applecare+ for sure but just need to keep their personal phone in the car as there no reason to carry it
    around.

     > they actually had a second cheap android phone they used when they were at work.  My boy had the burner
    on him :)



 Turn it the opposite way and fall on it again. 
 
     Need the suspect again though



 I would say roll with it, maybe get a case that will camouflage it enough for
you to forget it.  It’s like a broken nose, it has character. 
 
     I accidentally ran an iPhone 6 over w a dirt bike and it was bent worse than this. That was yearrrs ago
    and I JUST got a new phone. It worked fine and I actually liked how it fit in my hand haha

     lold alot! nice one take



 Check Apple first otherwise use it till it doesn’t work. Not worth paying for a
new phone if it works totally fine. Bend might be annoying but it’s worth not
paying another grand 
 
     Yea that's what I'm thinking. I wish I had an actual apple store near me, closest one is about an hour
    away. Might make the drive and see what they can do. I read somewhere that they can do chassis
    replacements but dunno how true that is.



 What kind of phone case was it in?? 
 
     OtterBox symmetry. I guess from now on I'm using more durable cases.



 If everything is working fine then just keep it and use it till your next phone
upgrade. 
 
     Nah fam, if the battery is bent it has way higher risk of thermal run off.

iPhone 14 doesn’t have Apple intelligence features but under screen time it’s there,"iPhone 14 doesn’t have Apple intelligence features but under screen time it’s there

 I just noticed this. Not sure if this has been asked.   Apple intelligence is
not supported by iPhone 14 and under settings there is no option for Apple
intelligence. But under screen time, there is one.   Any ideas why?

 It’s because screen time syncs across devices, so if you (or your child) have
another iPhone or iPad that supports it, you can access this setting to set the
rule. 
 
     Makes sense. Thank you



 Screen time covers all devices, it’s making the assumption the person could
potentially have access to other devices with Apple Intelligence. 
 
     [deleted]



 It doesn’t really make sense for them to ship a special OS without these
features listed. Much easier just to disable them on the phones that don’t
support it. 
 
     They disable menu options based on hardware all the time.

     It’s there but just disabled.   It’s just someone has missed off a feature flag for this view.

     I mean it can be there and to be disabled as a visible element in user interface, it’s the same principle
    because disabling the toggle still requires a flag in OS specific to the devices without Apple
    Intelligence. It’s Apple, not a livingroom startup

 I just seen reduce interruption on my focus modes and got excited Ggs 
 


 I'm not tech savvy by any means, but I don't understand why my 14 Pro Max, a
phone lauded to be a space age tech not even 3 years ago, can't handle new
features on current releases. I don't care if it runs slower when using AI, but
I spent $1,000 made of durable materials, right? Shouldn't the longevity of it
being a *technologically* relevant phone be good as well? 
 
     >I’m not tech savvy by any means  You don’t understand why a device that was released two years before new
    tech (that doesn’t even work fully on their current top of the line devices yet) was announced doesn’t
    support those new features?



 That's because it's software. It's all fucking software. They could upgrade the
ability of the device quite easily. Actually they just choose not to because
they wouldn't make money. It's that simple. ""Fuck you You're a stupid customer.""
Is their attitude essentially. I stopped buying Apple products a long time ago
because of shit like this. Most other companies aren't better but they're not
that bad  Buncha apple suckers here dam lol 
 
     Just wanted to put this out there: When SparserRestore, an exploit allowing editing system files your not
    supposed to be able to, came out, people used it to enable Apple Intelligence on unsupported models. It
    did not run very good at all. Now of course Apple would’ve done more optimizations if they had officially
    supported these devices, but Apple tries to never release something to a device that does not have a good
    user experience for that device.

     It literally isn’t just software though?   They’ve literally bumped up the RAM from 8gb to 16gb base for
    all their laptops because the hardware wasn’t enough for it?   Where do people learn this nonsense from
    lol.  Their “privacy” focus angle means they need to do a lot of the processing on device which is hard to
    do on older chips/less ram etc.



 They want you to upgrade. New features are behind a paywall. 
 
     No. Apple intelligence priorities on device computation and only reaches out to servers for more complex
    tasks (larger models) unlike google or Microsoft’s ai.   Which is how it should be.   The iPhone 14 simply
    doesn’t have the hardware required to run these calculations.



 The cynic in me says it’s there to remind you that you have features you’re
missing out on and to encourage you to upgrade.

 If you can’t get the code then you need to put your phone in recovery mode and

The iPhone Air is one of the most fantastic products Apple ever created.,"The iPhone Air is one of the most fantastic products Apple ever created.

I love this phone. I haven’t been this excited about a phone since the iPhone X.
It feels so new, fresh, and premium. It feels so amazing in your hand. I use
mine naked. No case and no screen protector, the way it was meant to be. I get
so many comments on it when people see it. It’s also so incredibly durable.
Built like a tank. I have the 17 Pro Max also and I swap me eSIM between the
two, but every time I use the Pro Max for a couple days I find myself missing
the Air. The only real downside for me is the lack of speaker.

 Maybe I need more friends but I’ve never had anyone comment anything on any
phone. Maybe the color if I have something loud or unique like Aquamarine, but
no one in my life is looking at my phone long enough to notice its slimness. 
 
     No because you’re probably an adult and no one gives a shit what phone you’re using or what color it is
    lol

     It reminds me of when something like Windows asks me if I’d recommend it to anyone. I don’t think you
    understand, nobody talks about these things.

     I can think of a few phones I’ve seen people give comments on, or that I’ve given or gotten comments on:
    - when a college buddy had a startac - the LG phone that blew up around 2005 - Motorola RAZR - first
    iPhone  - the iPhone 6s but in Rose Gold only - (that’s the one i got comments on :D) - iPhone X  Step
    function changes in form, function, or style merit reaction! I was kind of hoping my PM 17 world get
    comments - but too many people have them. Womp.

     I came from a ZFold, that one was the only phone I’ve ever owned that anyone’s commented on. Was honestly
    kind of annoying. I’m just waiting for the doctor too dude, I don’t want to talk about how much my phone
    cost

     Nah it's not just you. I even use a Z Fold 7 and unfolded it's as thin as a USB c port. I've never gotten
    a comment on it because realistically nobody cares and I'm not looking for comments either lol.

     The only time I’ve ever had anyone comment on my phone, was a week after the launch of the original
    iPhone, and a couple of teenagers thought it was cool that I had one.

     I bought an original iPhone day 1.  I got comments on that for a couple of months but nothing since then.

     The only person to ever ask me is my 12 year old nephew.

     You are safe from stupids.

     You notice it though

     Had to quickly double check the subreddit I was on when I saw   > I use mine naked.  Luckily the next
    sentence clarified things a little   > No case and no screen protector, the way it was meant to be.  Still
    have questions but figured I am just too old to know better. Will see myself out.

     You probably also keep a case on yours. I’m old enough to not care about other people’s phones, but they
    are god damn expensive and if someone whips out a phone with no case on, that will catch my eye:
    *internal monolog*  ARE YOU RECKL-whoa, that’s really thin

     Try keeping your current phone as long as you possibly can. If you’re rocking an iPhone 6 in 2025 everyone
    comments.

     Well you didn’t have a yellow Nokia banana phone in high school.

     Anecdotal maybe, but I'm 40 with a relatively small circle of friends and I've had multiple friends and
    coworkers ask about my phone since I got the air ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

     Well I remember when the iPad first arrived, used to travel on business for years and always stopped and
    asked someone about it in airports.  Once there was a guy and had a few people gathered around him asking
    about it.  For youngsters this may be passé but I would stop someone now since I haven’t seen the Air yet,
    though I will be ordering soon.

     Outside of family who knows I love quirky tech, a single random person commented on my Nothing Phone 1. I
    accidentally turned on Glyphs while paying for something.

     I haven’t had anyone comment on my phone since I had a razer flip phone but the orange 17pro has gotten a
    ton of comments

     Well. Everyone at my workplace wanted to see it. And we are all over 30. But we are an IT department.

     I love when people assume their reality is the only one

     I get comments in the elevator and at work all the time. Not just on the Air but if I’m rocking my bright
    orange 17 Pro Max people definitely notice it.

     I’ve had a random cashier ask about my phone. He couldn’t believe I was rocking my phone (at the time it
    was the iPhone X) with no case… I had to prove it was an iPhone lol. That was the strangest convo about
    phones I ever had

     Everyone comments on my iPhone 13 mini  “Is that one of the original iPhones?” “Is that phone from 2005”
    “Is that a Chinese wanna be iPhone” “How can you use such a tiny phone”  I’ll use it till I can’t anymore.
    I already had the battery replaced at an Apple Store.



 I see everyone is praising the air but for me 1 camera is unacceptable. Keeping
the 15pro and hoping for a better next year. 
 
     Really makes you wonder if this really is a one or two generation iPhone like the mini. They probably
    would improve the camera and speaker next gen then after that replace the whole thing with the foldable
    iPhone.

     I got the Air for my wife. It was a concern for me as well. She had an 11 and I asked her if she ever used
    the .05 button on her camera app (Ultra Wide Lenses) and that was a hard NO from her. She NEVER used her
    second camera. Also, the single camera is some fusion camera anyways and can do x2 zoom.  If you use the
    Ultra Wide Lens, then don’t get the Air. I rarely use it on my phone and that’s because it’s there and I
    hate not using features on my phone but I personally wouldn’t miss it.

     iPhone Air with a modified dual camera setup offering macro as well as 4× (presumably a digital zoom on 2×
    optical) would’ve almost been an instant buy for me. The battery life could have been an issue, but it’s
    not like I couldn’t top off at work if needed or use the MagSafe battery pack if I anticipated being out
    all day away from power. But I’m just a little too spoiled by the 5× optical on the 15 Pro Max to drop
    down to 2× digital.

     Samsung fitting all the camera and having no real battery issues makes the edge pretty impressive. This
    generation the iPhone may look better but the Samsung won. Next gen is going to be very interesting if the
    bring back the cameras

     Same. 15 pro is a pretty darn sexy phone with the titanium frame, especially with the natural titanium
    color. I went caseless + apple care+ and I do not feel the need to get a „prettier“ phone until there’s
    one an all display front (np bezels and no camera cut out).

     Same exact situation for me!

     Heard from a friend who works at Apple to wait for the 18. It will actually be different. Who knows these
    days.

     Same, and it costs more? No thanks

     The only way I could justify it is if its like a 100mp ultrawide.  No telephoto I'd maybeeee be ok with,
    but no ultrawide is unacceptable, I use or the telephoto for probably 80% of all my pictures.

     Reddit is a bubble. Apple cutting down Air's production by 90% tells me that most people think like you
    (and me) and would rather get the base 17 than the more expensive feature-less Air.

     The big problem for me is knowing they released it with just one camera so they could add a second one
    later.

     i used to feel the same way but apple’s image post processing has gotten so bad that it kinda makes the
    impressive hardware not worth it for me anymore

     It seems to be just a 16e Pro slim

     https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/22/iphone-air-orders-slashed-to-almost-end-of-production-levels-says-nikkei/

     Honestly, I don’t think one camera is a major issue.   It’s a 48mp sensor so it’ll still producing the
    same 1x and tele shots as the iPhone 16 it just doesn’t have the ultra wide which honestly, isn’t used be
    a lot of people anyway.



 Have the air. Replaced my 16 pro. After 2 weeks… it’s not as good. The wow wore
off. I have until end of day to decide if I’m returning. If 17 pro max was in
stock it’d be returned already. 
 
     Purchased the Air last weekend due to the surprise of how good it felt in the hands. After 5 days the wow
    wore off for me personally. Ended up going right back to the Apple Store to return the Air and swapped it
    for a 17 Pro Max in Cosmic Orange. Definitely used to the larger and bulkier size of the Max phones.
    Previous phone was a 14 Pro Max in Black(Space Grey??).

     Oh yeah that’s a crazy downgrade, while I don’t use the cameras on the Pros that much, battery and not
    overheating are big factors

     Same thing happened with me. Upgraded from a 13 Pro and after a week I traded it in for a 17 Pro. The
    battery only lasted around 10 hours for me, found myself constantly hunting for an outlet. It was also
    slow, a little laggy. Hopeful that the next versions will sort this all out. See more miniaturization in
    the pros, better hardware in the airs.

     [deleted]

     Wow has not worn off here yet. Phone feels great

     [deleted]

     I found a 17 pro and initiated return on my air on my last day after I transferred all my data  I really
    wanted to like the air. I do like the air. The form factor was great. But I really missed the wide angle
    camera and the battery didn’t cut it for me

     Have the air. Replaced my 14 pro. After 2 weeks...it's a lot better.

     I got the pro max, replacing my XS max. Honestly feels like a sidegrade since it's such a brick.

     Predicted this would happen to a lot of people. You can’t beat a tank of a battery and a better camera,
    and that’s only two advantages out of many more

     Its just a phone

     So are u planning to return it?

     I was in the same boat. Yesterday returned Air for base 17

     It’s crazy in Germany there’s no restocking fees and returns like in the United States. I’m so used to
    having that 60 day window with tech program at Best Buy. I had to pick between the one I really wanted
    otherwise I’d be stuck with something I can’t get rid of and don’t want. I did pick the air. I really like
    the phone. I barely used any of the other cameras on the 16 pro. Plus the speaker is loud enough to hear
    over the bath, that’s all that mattered to me.

     17 pro max is going to feel like you’re holding a child after using the Air  I did this and immediately
    came back to the Air

     may i ask, what bothers you the most?

     Did the same swap, don’t regret it for a second. Maybe it’s because I’ve transitioned to shooting pictures
    on a Fuji, so like I just want my phone to work and be nice to hold… not too worried about battery life
    and that’s basically the only real tradeoffs imo



 It’s just a phone 
 
     Exact same thing I said. Good grief. 

     That cost $1000 that’s inferior in every way possible. Only thing is being thin

     Yeah, that’s kind of how I feel with any phone really. I’m not talking about OP specifically but I feel
    like most people get so caught up on the bells & whistles too much. I think that’s due to a lot of tech
    “influencers” and YouTubers talking about it all.

     A bicycle is just a bicycle.   Obviously you have no clue what “just a phone” means. Like a rotary dial
    device on the wall? Or a device that in addition to making a phone call, sends text, access to internet,
    SMS, emails, edit docs, banking, elec etc. Modern smart phones are incredible engineering marvel…. And we
    have a whole generation of unimpressed losers who would be lost without one.

     If so, why are you spending time on this iPhone sub reddit.



 I recalled google had a modular phone project with 3D printing parts, so
everyone could pick whatever he/she wanted for an ideal phone. iPhone air may
not be for everyone but is lovable, but not yet an ideal phone for me. I’ll wait
for the next one at the same time pro max is still my pick.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ara 
 
     I’m still eyeing the Pro if I upgrade. The Air is intriguing, but I’ve gotten just a touch ton used to the
    5× zoom on my 15 Pro Max as the designated family documentarian. I don’t necessarily need the screen size
    of the Pro Max but I’m not giving up the zoom.  Had Apple released the Air with a 4× zoom, I’d have been
    tempted. And if they ever bring 4× to the baseline, I’d probably switch for sure.  (My personal ideal
    would be dual camera offering 0.5×/macro, 1×, 2× and 4×. I can leave ProRaw and ProRes. They were fun to
    experiment with, but nothing. I’m going to use anywhere near frequently. I just need to be able to get
    4K-60fps video and 24 or 48Mpx for general use.)



 Too many limitations for a $1000 phone . No thanks. 
 
     Do you think an ultrawide sensor and bottom speaker are worth $200 😆   The price is because the phone has
    new tech (the modem and radio chips), titanium body and the work done to increase thin and decrease
    weight.  The only limitation is one’s reticence to give up pro features they don’t use.



 Felt nice to hold but too many drawbacks for me 
 
     Yeah too many compromises to achieve the novelty that wears off fast. I really don’t see why anyone would
    spend more for this than the more capable base 17.



 [deleted] 
 
     I think it should have stayed at the $899 price point but I think the price I paid is fair. Having an
    extremely durable, extremely well built, and high material quality in a super thin and light design is
    worth the premium.   I have the iPhone 17, Air, and 17 Pro Max and the Air is and will continue to be my
    main until v2 comes out.   And much to the chagrin of Air haters on Reddit (which is weird given that
    they’re not forced to buy this phone), battery life is more than good enough.

     Lol that’s a bit extreme.  But I agree that the price point is odd. $999 when it’s less capable than last
    year’s Pro, $200 more than this year’s baseline (which has undergone the biggest glow up in iPhone
    history) which is probably going to hold the undisputed crown for “best bang for your buck.” It’s aiming
    for a *very* specific niche. I genuinely hope it doesn’t become the next Mini, because it is so close to
    being an excellent device. Just maybe not all the way there on this first generation.  I feel like it
    needed to take the $899 price point or they needed to have figured out a way to get a second camera on
    there to improve the overall capabilities.  It’s super impressive from an engineering and industrial
    design standpoint that doesn’t always translate into real world practicality or mass market sales. Most
    people don’t care about those things. They just care about what they feel like they’re getting for their
    money.



 It’s a phone. 
 


 …you have two phones and switch back and forth.  *sigh* 😒  Sometimes I really
hate this place

Comparison of the iPhone 17 and 16 series frames,"Comparison of the iPhone 17 and 16 series frames

 the standard iPhone 17’s screen has seen a pretty good upgrade this time, and
it seems Apple is treating all models equally.

 Does the 17 Pro max really have smaller bezels than the 17 Pro? In the second
picture, it shows 1.36mm bezels, while the 17 Pro has 1.43mm. 
 
     Yes, very slight, but they are a bit smaller

     yeeah it was like that last year i noticed .they put the thinnest bezels on the pm series



 Is the bezels on 17 Pro bigger than 16 Pro? 
 
     Yeah its a strange regression, gsmarena also confirms this with the 17pm having a screen to body ratio of
    90.7% vs the 16pm of 91.4%

     how is this not getting more downvotes, u can literally see the size of the bezel on each phone

     It literally says they are the same size…  The frame color on the 17 is similar to the bezel making it
    look like that,



 Why do the bezels look bigger on 17pm?

    ed7f762db1b  because it’s 17 Pro, not Pro Max. The dynamic island is bigger on the picture, even tho it
    isn’t irl

     They are. I recommend walking into your local phone store and seeing the lineup for yourself. I went just
    to see the Air, but also took a glimpse at the 17 series. They looked so sleek and elegant, I was baffled.
    The iphones underneath looked like they came out 5 years before by comparison. Sounds like all praise
    right?   Well turns out, I flipped the sleeks phones over and realized I was staring at the 16Pro & 16Pro
    Max. The outdated 5yo looking phones underneath? Those were unfortunately the 17Pro and 17Pro Max.   And
    the Air, which I was most excited about, didn't feel as thin & light as I was expecting. Social media is
    completely exaggerating the sensation. I walked out of the store with a feeling of indifference.   From a
    business perspective, that's easily the worst feeling you can extract from your customers. It's better for
    a customer to hate your product than to feel indifferent towards it. Still rooting for Apple though. The
    iPad and Mac lineup is better than ever. They can definitely bring the iPhone to new heights if they focus
    and hone in on a single identity/philosophy. During the Steve era, that's what made iPhone great. It was
    unabashedly iPhone. Tim should consider directing the team with a parallel strategy.

 Remember   That excuse of titanium heats alot is bs titanium was only the side
frame of the phone not the whole frame. So about 10% titanium and 90% Aluminium
they just didn't want to make a whole titanium plateau they could have just use
titanium on the side and stainless steel the rest of the frame... and that
should've sold me to get one. 
 
     It wouldn't be called a unibody frame then.

     It’s the glass back that was the problem. Old phones were built bolted to the frame with glass sandwiching
    both sides. Glass is an insulator. New phones have an aluminium frame under the back glass that whisks
    heat away to the sides and plateau. Instead you want.. no glass? So no wireless charging. Or have a cutout
    for the glass ok. Hmm steel or titanium unibody with glass cutout is gonna double the cost of the phone
    why shall we do? Oh yea, there is this great heat conducting light metal called aluminium!

     Wouldn't be surprised if they would do that. I think they went with all aluminium this year to find an
    excuse to sell the upgrade with the next year's models

     Yea, it was mostly the glass back that was the limiting factor, not the titanium. They could have kept the
    titanium and switched the glass for aluminum, and seen a huge improvement.

     I wonder if tariffs play a role on choosing aluminum



 bezel became thicker? 
 
     Yes! Screen to body ratio in 17 pro max is 90.7% in 16PM it was 91.4%



 I guess I've just seen seen too many poorly drawn prints - the picture is wrong.
Notice on the left phone, the right vertical line does not match the right
vertical edge of the phone 
 


 17 is the Star of the Show. 
 
     17 is legit. Best phone I have had in a long time.

     Looks like 16 is lol



 The dimensions between generations have changed - I noticed that the 17 pro and
pro max are slightly bigger than their 16 counterparts but with same screen size
(pixels).  The 17 has the exact same dimensions as 16 pro, and same screen size
(pixels). Therefore the 17 has thinner bezels than 17 pro. 
 
     So does that mean that I can buy an iPhone 16 Pro screen protector and use it on a iPhone 17?👀



 funny comparing the more expensive Pixel 10 with its big bezels to the cheaper
iphone 17 this year which has better hardware in every way. Insane fail by
Google this year.

Just shattered my iPhone 15pro. Need to know my options. More in body.,"Just shattered my iPhone 15pro. Need to know my options. More in body.

My iPhone 15 pro fell off of my truck bed because I was in a hurry and left it
there. It fell in the middle of an intersection. The outer edge all looks great,
it’s just the front and back. The front is bulging up by where the cameras are
on the back side. I think it fell down and was facing up, then a car ran over it
and because of the camera bulge in the back, the weight pushed the front screen
up at the top right corner. By the time I picked it up about 15 minutes
later….this is how it was. I have Verizon, it’s on a pay as you go plan for 30
months…maybe 36 months? I don’t have apple care because I’ve never even cracked
a screen in 20+ years of cell phones. It still kinda works… but don’t know if
it’s worth repairing. What are my least expensive options for replacement of
something identical or possibly newer?

 “It’s just the front and back”  Dude, that’s like the whole phone 🤨

 If you don't have AppleCare, or other phone insurance, you'll need a new phone.
Get a case! 
 
     No problem if you don’t have AppleCare. Just get a Time Machine and go back and tell yourself to buy
    AppleCare when you buy your phone.

     I had a case , but my truck won that battle.

     What if you purchase apple care after the fact

     You mean, get a head.

     Are there cases designed to support the weight of a car?



 Just shot my foot off. Wondering what my options are? 
 
     Foot Bar employee says my ankle is out of warranty and I need a replacement from the knee down?? wtf, I
    have ToeCare+?!

     replace the casing.  foot itself is fine.



 I used to be a lead technician at the Apple store for a few years.  \- This is
not repairable as the enclosure (frame) of the phone will have too many knicks
and dents preventing the back and front glass replacement from sitting flush.
\- If you do not have AppleCare (assuming you do not because you posted this in
the first place) you can still go to the Apple store and attempt to do a walk in
at the genius bar (may have to wait on stand-by for a while) and they can offer
an ""out of warranty replacement"".  While still hundreds of dollars probably
around $600, it is brand new and it is same day in the store.  They collect the
broken one, you get the new one and that's it, same color, same model, you
cannot ""upgrade"" or ask for different anything.  The other caveat is that the
phone they give you has no warranty and no option to add AppleCare to that one,
it's ""as is"".  \- Finally the other option would simply be to upgrade to the
latest device.  If you owe any money on this broken device, you may need to
consider if paying off what you owe and upgrading is better than an out of
warranty replacement on top of still paying what you owe.  \- You do NOT want
to:  Take it to a ""repair shop"", take it to Best Buy, or go to one of those
kiosks at the mall.  None of these places have Apple certified parts.  You do
not want some random guy watching a ""how to video"" on YouTube as he ""fixes"" your
phone with fake parts from Amazon and charges you $300.  It is cheaper, but you
get a Frankenstein phone that will most likely still die out then you end up at
the Apple store anyway but they deny service because its been tampered with.  I
have seen all of the horror stories, its not worth it.  Always ALWAYS buy
AppleCare Plus moving forward.  $1,000 phone made of glass, use your head and
don't repeat this mistake. 
 
     “$1000 phone made of glass” is the most striking part for me. And I have seen independent stores breaking
    the faceID while replacing the battery and not taking any accountability, so for me either DIY or Apple
    for repairs.

     [removed]

     This guy has some good advice if op is interested👆

     This is just a small nit, but as far as I‘s aware Best Buy is an AASP so if they repair your iPhone you
    are getting Apple Parts installed by Apple certified technicians.

     Yup. I brought apple care+ with my 16PM on launch day. Hadn’t had to use it until around 4 weeks ago where
    I broke the back glass, then two weeks after getting it repaired I broke it again. Got a brand new iPhone.
    Tbf o did well for no case or screen protector since September  https://preview.redd.it/n62yb58q7a4f1.jpeg
    ?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54755b9e046e6b0010e65e67ddd0b5214e613e53

     In Australia such a replacement gets consumer law coverage. And 90 days or the original warranty end date
    (whichever is the later). This probably differs country to country.   I thought I’d read that some
    countries allow AppleCare to be purchased on a swapped phone. Check local conditions.   Also, authorized
    apple repair centers do repairs the same way an Apple Store would. Just check if such a place really is
    authorized.

     If I bought apple care from the first phone I had I would've spent over 2k and not gaining a single
    benefit from it.

     > Always ALWAYS buy AppleCare Plus moving forward.  Insurance should be reserved for expenses that can
    ruin or significant degrade your life. Car insurance or home insurance makes sense because if there's
    damage in the tens or hundreds of thousands, it can negatively impact your life.  Far more people can
    write off a $1000 expense as an oopsie. Apple makes money off of Applecare+, which means that for most
    people, most of the time- they won't get their moneys worth.

     Re the above, some points.  The enclosure can be replaced with a donor or third party housing. Apple won’t
    do it, but it’s commonly done, very possible.  The only thing that matters with a phone in this condition
    is whether the motherboard is functional, firstly for data recovery, and secondly because a full repair
    might still be possible if it does function.  Frankenstein phones are perfectly fine. I challenge you to
    tell the difference between a phone with entirely replaced housing and equivalent soft OLED screen - You
    won’t be able to. The quality is excellent. Sure you have to trust the person doing it, but a bad outcome
    won’t be because of the parts.  Apple care or phone insurance is always a good idea for an expensive phone
    which has a high chance of being dropped. But sadly, it won’t cover data recovery efforts which may be
    wanted in this case - but if iCloud was enabled, all good.

     I agree with the first part. But the second part is a insult to private repair practices. Most of the time
    we try to use genuine parts. And still cheaper then apple depending on the device and parts. (Agree with
    the best buy thing and mall kiosks though)

     When my daughters face ID on her 13 pro stopped working apple sent me to Best Buy (nearest apple store is
    3 hours away) to have it tested and then they arranged to have it sent into apple for warranty repair. The
    guy said they have a partnership with best buy so I would assume they do have certified parts

     How does my iPhone survive multiple attempts at being thrown from the second floor of my house to the 1st?
    (I have a 2yo). Only thing that gets damaged is the screen protector

     Best buy does have authentic parts, they would do the same thing for you as apple, just take longer

     Better yet, why not make all repair parts available for the repair industry, so that we don't end up with
    a Frankenstein phone?    It's just ridiculous that these parts are not made available and the only way to
    repair is to send the device to Apple, where you just change the boards and can't even do board level
    repairs...

     If they replace the phone through the Genius Bar, they can add AppleCare as long as the phone is less than
    two years old.

     Just small thing here. After the repair they changed this and now they do have the ability to add
    AppleCare as long it’s within a certain window, I believe 2 years?

     Most of that is true EXCEPT, iPhones replaced out of warranty do come with warranty and it DOES give you
    the option to add AppleCare+ - Another Repair Technician.  And agreed, definitely always buy AppleCare+.

     On the other hand, 20 years of AppleCare vs a single 600 dollar event in OP’s defense…

     Yeah I can tell you work for the Apple store lol. No ""repair shops""? Yeah well as a repair shop owner I
    disagree, we have access to OEM parts if the customer wants them, and I and many others know what they're
    doing and could fix this whole phone up.  The Apple store quotes absurd amounts of money for simple
    repairs in hopes that you buy a new phone, so I genuinely think repair shops are the better option in some
    cases. I've seen it all too! I've seen the Apple store quote hundreds of dollars because the charging port
    was full of pocket lint! Don't pretend like you're better than us just because you work for Apple, there
    are always people smarter than you, and also me.



 If you drop it again it should cancel out and it’ll fix itself.

 microwave it for 35 seconds to lets the glass melt and smooth over 
 
     Gonna need atleast a few minutes in there.

     Bro my phone stopped working!!! WTH



 you're options are to buy a new phone or don't 
 
     This dude or lady has to be young and I’m amazed I’m still watching this says ALOT about my life



 Ur wallet is definitely SOL. it might be cheaper to pay off the remaining
balance and trade in to a 16 series 
 


 Think of if this way: You have saved all that money over the years by never
getting apple care. Now buying a new phone will have paid for itself. 
 


 gonna be full device replacement atp

Are Belkin screen protectors sold at apple stores a ripoff?,"Are Belkin screen protectors sold at apple stores a ripoff?

I bought a 40$ screen protector for my iPhone 16 pro max from Apple store about
6 months ago. The Apple sales rep was very clear that cracks in the screen
protector are covered under the warranty of the screen protector. In a few
months, my screen protector cracked. I contacted Belkin, and they sent a
replacement without hassle. After another couple of months, the new screen
protector cracked again. I contacted Belkin again. This time, they declined
coverage. This is what Belkin told me via email ""Our warranty policy covers
defects in materials and workmanship, but it does not extend to damages such as
accidental drops, cracks, or normal wear and tear.""   WTF does defect in
material and workmanship mean for a screen protector? What does the warranty
cover if it doesn't cover cracks? If cracks are not covered, then 40$ for a
piece of plastic is a total rip off. Also, I never had any screen protector
crack so soon. A 10$ screen protector from Amazon often worked for more than a
year without issue. Wondering if anyone else had a similar experience.    Edit:
location I bought the screen protector was at an Apple Store in San Jose,
California, USA.

 I think they’re a pretty big ripoff. You can buy 3 of similar quality on amazon
for $10-20. And most come with mechanism that makes installation extremely easy. 
 
     Totally agree. 

     The alignment frame for mechanism?



 I think the main advantage to getting one at the Apple Store is that they have a
machine that will put it on your phone perfectly.   That said, I’ve never had a
screen protector and I’ve never had a cracked screen. 
 
     The ones I’ve used from Spigen come with 2 and have applicators that make it nearly impossible to mess up.

     Without a screen protector, do you get scratches on your iPhone screen? How do you avoid that? 



 Yes, they're terrible value and the quality is arguably worse than the ones you
can get from ESR (a 3-pack of these is 9 bucks on Amazon). In general, I would
avoid purchasing any accessories from the Apple Store directly, especially
these. Screen protectors nowadays are mostly to avoid scratches, the glass on
newer iPhone models is very shatter resistant. 
 
     Agree with you. Screen protectors are mainly there for scratches only



 <deleted>  Go talk to the store, but be courteous, not angry.  The store
employees will know which manager to give you to that will make things right.
If you come in confrontational…they know which manager to send you to in that
case, too.  You’ve got every right to be upset, but the problem that led to this
wasn’t from anyone inside that store.  Trust me, not even the managers are
reading the warranty policies of 3rd party products to see if they change from
day to day, much less the hourly workers. 
 
     Good to hear your input. Thanks for sharing. 



 i’ve broken that Belkin screen 4 times and got all replaced for free. I think it
it’s paid itself off 
 
     Same here, been using it since the iPhone X, through the 13PM, the 14PM and now the 15PM, and any time it
    has even scuffed I send a ticket to Belkin, and they ship me a replacement   I don’t understand the logic
    of some people here, you are buying a +1000$ phone and you are spending 5-10$ to protect the screen that
    costs like 400 to replace?



 Just buy them on Amazon from spigen. Pretty good quality and pretty affordable 
 


 The Belkin screen protector from Apple is one of very few protectors without a
black border and fits perfectly on the screen with no fit and alignment issues. 
 
     Ok Belkin lover, Most of the screen protector on Amazon doesn’t have a black border. 



 These are literally the worst. I am already on replacement number 4 and it’s
always the border that starts cracking on random spots. The first one broke
after less than a week! All I did was carry two phones in my pocket.   I am in
Germany and they provide a form online that you fill out and you just select
„Apple warranty replacement“ and they don’t even ask what happened  
 
     Mine screen protectors cracked very easily too during both the times. During the second time the phone
    cracked,  I filled out application on Belkin's website to ask for replacement, and they said cracks aren't
    covered. I emailed back saying that they covered cracks and had in fact sent me a replacement the first
    time. They were very clear in their response the second time that the cracks are not covered.



 I think the issue is whether the Apple Store misled you regarding the Belkin
warranty. A separate issue is whether $40 is too much to pay for a screen cover,
but if some are getting them replaced for free, then maybe it’s a good deal for
them (and not a ‘ripoff’). I’ve never expected a screen protector to be covered
for accidental cracking, but also don’t pay that much. 
 
     1. The Apple Store definitely misled me. They guy who sold me was very clear cracks were covered.  2.
    Belkin sent me a screen protector first time it cracked. But they refused it the second time. So their
    behavior is shady. If crack wasn’t covered under the insurance, why cover it the first time.  3. From this
    same post, one person said they have gotten screen protector covered by warranty even 4 times after
    cracking it without hassle. So they are covering some client’s cracked screen, but not others. Shady.

 You do this for a living? Looks very experienced, almost casual. 
 
     Yeah! I repair all kinds of phones, consoles (even back to the retro nes, Dreamcast, etc). I appreciate
    that, I always try my best <3



 How much does a replacement screen end up costing? 
 
     What I charge the customer or how much it costs my shop?



 No True Tone after such replacement, sadly 
 
     [deleted]

     i never liked True Tone... takes all the blue from the screen. am i seeing something wrong?

     I have an iCopy plus to copy data from screen to screen.

     Why is that?



 I’m ashamed to say, but I watched this loop through more than once and thought,
“why does he keep taking it apart and putting it back together?” 
 
     Same here



 I heard the glass back of the X is not replaceable. Well, not practically
anyway.   True/False? 
 
     True.   It’s possible and my shop used to do it. The problem is, you have to replace the entire case of
    the iPhone typically and Apple does not sell them. That leaves a market for Chinese clones to fill. The
    clones however are poor quality and since part of your signal on your phone comes from the antenna around
    your case, you end up with poor service and a whole list of other problems unless you find a donor case
    from an already broken phone. It’s just not worth the money or effort.



 Does the phone lose water resistance after a repair like this? Or can it be re
sealed during the process? 
 
     It does lose water resistance. I still replace the seals, but nothing is as good as apples original seals
    but it’s better than nothing haha



 Is there a place you can get screens with the same quality as the OEM ones?
Cheap ebay ones don’t seem to be as good.  What I normally do when I need to
replace an iPhone screen is buying an iCloud locked one for cheap and replace
it’s screen with the broken one. Of course I have only done it a few times for
people in the family 
 
     Hey, if you want to seriously do it, you need to find a good source in China.  They ARE out there, and
    they will be more expensive than the cheap eBay/amazon quality ones. A 6s screen from eBay for $16 will
    also cost you around $16 in China, but minimum order quantity of $300.  BUT the quality of the Chinese $16
    screen compared to eBay $16 screen is IMMACULATE.  Chinese $16 iphone 6S screen is legit 1:1 OEM. The eBay
    $16 screen is a $7 Chinese screen, resold for $16 for profit(that’s how eBay reselling works)



 Where’s the ESD strap?! 
 
     No ESD strap, no go for me.



 [deleted] 
 
     It’s basically a slimmer pry tool. After a while the adhesive is easier to work with, so a heat gun is not
    necessary. With experience, you know where to and how much pressure to apply to be able to take the screen
    off without heating it up



 Damn I used to do phone replacement screens in high school, but haven’t done
them in so long because screen prices have gone up so much. X screen prices are
just now getting low enough to try and replace.

After 12 years with android its time to give Apple another go (2 weeks later),"After 12 years with android its time to give Apple another go (2 weeks later)

Pic of [setup](https://imgur.com/a/8Vs0U2q)  Hello, some of you may have seen my
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/115py24/after_12_years_with_andr
oid_its_time_to_give/) where i showed my switch to iphone and talked a bit about
why i decided to give IOS a go.   It has now been 2 weeks so i wanted to share
my experience with switching to a new ecosystem as a long time android user.
*Warning its a long post*  **Airpods pro (Good things)**  - Legit the best
earbuds i have tried so far, ive used earbuds from samsung, sennheiser, jabra
and sony and overall i think apple makes the best. Sennheiser is a good second.
- Comfort is top notch and i can wear them for hours without problems and they
sit pretty sturdy even with a fast bike ride.  - Noice canceling is next level,
everytime i wear them i feel like im wearing a helmet where all noise are mostly
gone with only my music left.    - Switching between my watch, ipad and iphone
is seamless and super easy.  **(bad things about the airpods)**  - THEY ARE
SLIPPERY AS HELL. Legit never dropped earbuds as many times as i have with this
single product.   - They have a weird glitch sometimes where one earbud will
suddenly just be a little more louder than the other. They ususally go back to
normal on their own but still annoying.  - This is a nitpick. I hate the color,
i wish they were black since the white gets scratched easily and they are super
visible.   **Apple watch (Good things)**  - The design of the watch is perfect.
I think apple made the right choice sticking with this design and just improving
it each year. Its light, looks great and the watch faces makes it seem like a
natural watch.    - Battery has been great! I checked apples website and they
promise 18 hours of use so i was prepared to charge everyday around 22 but i was
generally surprised to see i could get almost 2 days of use out of them before
they needed to be charged and that is with sleep tracking.   - Fitness features
are more refined than on android. On my galaxy watch 4 after a 15 minutes run on
treadmill on 15 km/hr it would rate my heartrate at 199 which is maximum which
would put me at a horrible shape. The apple watch rated my heartrate at a more
believable 169. Overall its also much easier to use and more fun as navigation
is fluid and workouts are motivated with rings and medals.   **(bad things about
apple watch)**   - Sleep tracking should have more information and also give me
some kind of rating whether im sleeping right or not.    **Iphone (good
things)**   - Love the design, the boxy flat screen is just great and feels so
good to hold (insert joke).   - Apps are much better optimized on apple and even
the gym app i use is a WHOLE DIFFERENT app on iphone compared to android which
is kind of annoying but at least i can use the better version now.   - I play a
lot of games on phone (dont judge me) and for some reason i want to play even
more on my iphone. Maybe its for nostalgic reasons cuz i used to have an ipod
touch where i spend all day playing on it.   - The processor is fast and more
importantly ITS COOL on a few androids i have had i always experience a lot of
heat from the back of the device when used intensely, on iphone i only
experience this when im charging.  - Switching over my whatsapp and
messages/contacts was much easier than it used to be (for context i switched
from an s21 ultra) all my stuff was there and ready to be used. The backup and
restore feature on iphone is also much better. I had to return the first iphone
i bought cuz it had a dead pixel i noticed a little late so i was given a new
one, when i came home and set it up using the backup from the first iphone it
had all my stuff ready with widgets and appdata (like i never left) and only
needed a password or 2 for my mails.    - Face ID is such a nice feature to have
in the cold since i dont need to remove my gloves to get into my device. I just
need to hold it up to my face.   - Delightful haptics   **(bad things about
Iphone)**   - Battery life has been decent but its not great for heavy use. I
can kill it using it from 7 in the morning to 21 in the evening which is decent
but doesn´t beat my s21 ultra which usually had 30% left after the same day so
could still go out (but makes sense with the bigger body).  - Charging is slow,
it takes about 2 hours from 15 to 100 where i was so used to charging my devices
full in 58 minutes.   - The size of the phone is a bit too small for my liking,
i find myself not enjoying scrolling webpages or watching something as much as i
used to. I did try the iphone 14 pro max but that device IS WAY TOO BIG and
apple does not use that space more efficient. Everything on the pro max just
looks like an iphone 14 pro zoomed in instead of giving me more icons on my
homescreen or having the option to do splitscreen. For some reason i think my
s21 ultra is easy to hold and use while the pro max is heavy and hard to hold. I
think its because apple focused on making the pro max wider and heavier while
samsung focused on taller and slimmer. I think samsungs approach is the right
one.  - Transfering data is a pain. I really do not like itunes, since it only
regonized very few file types and im forced to use third party apps to transfer
alot of movies and some important documents i keep on me. Androids drag and drop
is just so much simplier.  - File types on Iphone are a mess, as a student i
usually have to open a lot of different file types i get send or the instructor
put out for us. Iphone seems to have issues regonizing some filetypes and i even
had to google how to open a PDF on iphone. Turns out i could either pay a
monthly fee for an app or insert the pdf into the books app where i then can
open to view content. Which is pretty annoying overall as there are many times
where on android i can pretty much read and save anything i want from the web.
- Iphone can be boring at times, i do miss being able to customize my device by
redoing my whole homescreen or changing launcher or fiddling with widgets i can
make myself. On iphone you get what you have, and it becomes a bit boring
looking at the same homescreen after a while (though this is more of a personal
note since most dont really care).  - Lack of emulators is also a factor why
iphone can be boring, there are so many interesting apps you can get on android
that just does not exist on iphone. As i mentioned before i play a lot of games
on my phone where emulators is a big part of that. I used to play PS1, N64 and
snes all on the go on my samsung where i just dont have the same options on
iphone unless i do some weird workaround that only works for 7 days.   - Siri is
useless, enough said.   - Reminders isnt really helpful, as on android i can go
""hey google, remind me to pick up my tickets on tuesday at 13"" and then at
tuesday 12 i would get a notification reminding me of that where iphone dont
remind me with notification it just shows a plus one on my reminders app.   -
Apple lightning port is super annoying (nitpick) since with ipad it uses USB C
and everything else i own uses USB C. I normally only have 1 USB C cable near my
desk to charge everything but due to iphone i now need to have 2 even when i
leave for UNI or work.   - Notifications are a mess, sometimes i get notified
other times i dont and it only groups notifications after when i recieved them.
So i usually miss a few things since they get buried under the other new
notifications i get where on android i can see them all at once.     Phew, that
was a long post but i wanted to be thorough with my points.  So the big question
after all of this is ""will i keep moving forward with apple?"" And the answer
is....... prob not.  There are too much i miss from android where i feel like
apple is a fresh new place i explored vs coming home to android where i feel at
ease. As exciting as it has been using apple the back of my head have that
feeling of ""when am i going back home (android)"" which is a shame cuz i did
enjoy using em.  I will keep using my airpods pro and ipad (cuz android tablets
are shit) but in a month or two im gonna sell my iphone for 90% of the cost and
get me a s23 plus. The apple watch will be a gift for someone.    If you have
any questions feel free to ask.

 For sleep tracking, give autosleep a try. You might find exactly what you’re
looking for.

     Sounds good I will give it a shot.

taking notes.   >       Reminders isnt really helpful, as on android i can go

the setting in notification. Probably the notification uncheck. I use alot the
Apple Watch with Siri to create a reminder and works fine, with notification.
>       Sleep tracking should have more information and also give me some kind

reliable. So take it with a grain of salt.   Yes, the sleeping data taking with
the watch natively is basic. You can use a sleeping app. I use SleepWatch.
Again, take the data with a few grains of salt. 
 


 I’m just giving iOS another go because my girlfriend and we’ll over half of my
family have iPhones. I like the inclusion, and how well apple works with apple.
Like the air drop, FaceTime, I love the messaging. Far better than Google
messages because still suck even if it’s android to android. And the reason to
have a phone is to stay in contact with other people. But I miss the
customization on android, specifically how much you can change the Home Screen
and the font, also transparency of the keyboard. Face ID is great, but in my
opinion not better than the fingerprint once you learn the sweet spot. I miss
the spen. Yes messaging is better on iOS, but why doesn’t iOS have scheduled
messages it is not a gimmick by any means.  I do plan to own both android and
iOS. I forgot to also mention the walkie talkie feature is cute thing to do with
my girlfriend. 
 


 I don’t think you used it long enough. Example, opening a pdf is as simple as
tapping it in the files app. That’s it. No need for books app or anything. 
 
     We used Books, or iBooks, back in the days before Files for keeping PDFs on our devices. I expect there’s
    still some old tips out there the OP might have Googled.



 I agree that siri sucks, i turned it of like 5 years ago also apple stuff is
very restrictive because apple doesn't like you messing with the stuff you
bought 
 
     I use Siri to set timers and alarms. That’s it.

     Siri is not great, but it integrates reasonably well with other apps. On Siri, I can say “using Todoist,
    remind me to schedule a team meeting today at 2pm” and it will create a task in Todoist. Works reliably
    100% of the time (although doesn’t work if you do it through Apple Watch).   While on Android you can do
    the same by saying “Add schedule a team meeting today at 2pm to my list on Todoist”, it fails to
    understand the command in 50% of the cases even if it correctly recognizes the whole sentence. And if you
    set up Google Keep as your default reminder app in Assistant settings, it will not work at all, offering
    to add this to Keep all the time.



 You can transfer files to the iPhone using a USB thumb drive. Buy a lightning-
USB adapter and the thumb drive will show up in the Files app as another drive.
I got a cheap non-branded adapter  and it works. Apple sells one too, but it is
very expensive, as expected. 
 


 Yeah I feel like anyone that tries to switch after being in one boat or the
other always goes back. That’s the case for me. I tried Android after being
Apple for years and found I kept going back to the iPhone because things weren’t
available on the android. Too immersed in the ecosystem.   I agree with some of
the big pain points on Apple as well. With the onslaught of subscription based
apps I’d like to be able to just make my own and put them on my phone for
personal use but 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👎🏻 that ain’t happening. Siri isn’t as functional as it
should be. Reminders is a joke. I use the native email app because it’s a one
stop shop and it’s clean and uniform.  Customization- I was looking forward to
this the most when I switched. But… the more I tried the more I discovered there
were almost TOOO many ways and choices (just me?) and I longed for the
simplicity of iPhone, as limiting as it was.  The ONE thing I do wish Apple /
iPhones had is the Knox secure profile. It was nice to separate work / home and
have that added layer of privacy / separation.   💯🙏🏻 
 
     Very good points.   I do believe it’s because I have grown way too accustomed to android to be able to
    fully make the switch.   But in the end they are both great and I feel lucky to be able to explore both.

     I switched like 2 years ago and don’t plan to go back to android. Before that, I had used android since
    the T-Mobile G1 (first android phone).  There’s alot of features that iPhones lack but they just work. And
    slowly they’re catching up in some ways.



 Reminders should give you notifications just fine. There is a pitfall I ran into
when switching from android myself, maybe that's your issue too: You have to
create one reminder by hand in the app, not using Siri. Then it asks you if it
may send notifications. You have to allow it.   I always used Siri to create
reminders, never opened the app. So it could never ask for permission and didn't
show notifications. 
 
     Thanks! That worked.   I also tried only using Siri and it never reminded me I guess this is the reason.



 Long time apple user. I don’t understand the iTunes issue. Yes, iTunes sucks and
it’s bloated. I haven’t used iTunes in *years*. There’s no need. 
 
     Could you explain? Everytime I want to add new music to my phone I have to plug it into my PC and use
    iTunes sync to get it to appear in my music app.

     I started streaming a lot more with my iPhone than my Androids. I have about 10gb of music ripped from cds
    and flac, and anytime I got an Android I’d either copy by usb or insert an sd card and be good to go.   I
    miss having my music locally, but a handful of us put in for a Spotify family membership and that works,
    but it’s not great.



 I don’t understand the pdf file type problem? I’ve never experienced an issue
with pdfs and I didn’t purchase anything to view or manipulate them. I can save
pdfs easy to files. 
 
     Same. I frequently email PDF’s to myself from a desktop. Opening them and saving them on the iPhone has
    never been an issue.

 Have you ever laid down to watch tv at night and there was a water bottle on a
table blocking the screen and you tried to ignore it but just couldn't? 
 
     You've hit \\_____/ on the head

     Lonely cursor also comes to mind.

     My God you described it better than I did. Watching any full screen video on iPhone X would be just like
    this, but worse. Because you can't fucking get rid of whatever's blocking the screen.

     This happened to me last night!

     Exactly. What an eyesore.

     This... this reply is just perfect.

     Drives me crazy just thinking about it

     Calm down guys.   Pretty sure all of these problems will be worked out on the iPhone VIIII.   Can’t wait
    for the VIII!

     I'm actually surprised they're treating it this way. It's not a horrible intrusion, but enough to notice
    and feel like it's blocking something. When I saw the 'tab' design, I assumed they'd fill in the sides of
    it with a black bar of info (battery, signal, time, etc.), or just a solid to make it less noticeable.

     Bingo!

     Kinda helps with knowing where's up and down?

     /r/Fiveheads



 This is basically what Samsung did with it’s S8. Although they also have a bezel
below the screen. 
 
     Yeah but the S8 still has a chin and forehead, at least this pic has a full forehead lol. Also, I hate
    watching videos then having a chunk of it missing because of the camera and sensors, having it uniform
    would be better

     [removed]

     And also G6.

     [deleted]

     I think that the design Apple went with is so that you can easily tell which way is up for the phone.

     what exactly is a bezel?

     I'm mostly an amdroid guy, but I have to admit that I really like what apple did with the bezels.

     It looks more balanced imo

     Which I think looks better just in terms of symmetry

     On one hand, Apple's approach gives you more display area. Looks odd, particularly in landscape, but you
    are getting more.  But it looks odd, especially in landscape. Perhaps we will get use to it, or Apple will
    figure out a way to hide all the sensors and camera lens under the screen.



 I love the new approach to tucking away the cellular and battery data but I'm
wondering how screenshots will look, will it cut out the cell info?   It might
be a pain in the butt for app developers to adjust the size of apps just for the
X dimensions.   Just my thoughts since seeing it 
 
     The Essential Phone just fills in that area, https://youtu.be/-_WbmSxZnB8?t=5m52s  Though its a lot
    smaller of an area on the iPhone X...

     The screenshots just fill in where the notch would be with the UI that’s hiding behind the notch.

     This is an interesting question. My guess is it takes all the information but it would look very odd on a
    non iPhone x.

     Also ... what is the screen resolution?  I mean how do you express it?  Apple says ""2,436x1,135-pixels""
    ... but is it really?  I smell a class action over the missing pixels.  That is, **unless** the 2,436
    pixel dimension is being measured inward from the unibrow.  If it's done that way then 'free pixels' I
    guess.  In summary:  Does it have 2,764,860 total pixels?  Because it should.  That's basic math.



 For a company that cares so much about aesthetics and design it is an odd choice
to go with the notch. 
 
     They had their fair share of headscratching ideas. Just remember how Apple Pencil and the new mouse are
    charged. Or that battery case.

     The design feature I found the strangest was when they moved to a camera that stuck out. Made no sense.

     It will be fixed when the iPhone XXX ships. Bright to you by pornhub.

     They know it doesn't look great. They wanted to try a design different than other slim bezel phones on the
    market. More importantly, they wanted to use this as a stepping stone towards no bezel all. The goal is to
    eventually eliminate the bezel entirely.  If they waited for technology to mature, it would be tough for
    them to jump immediately from the now relatively large bezel of the iPhone to a bezel-less design. I
    suspect in future iterations of the iPhone X will feature smaller bumps and will be a selling point in
    each version. ""In the iPhone X2, the sensor array size has been reduced by 10%!""

     I respect Steve Jobs so this isn't a diss, but I do think he'd have fired whoever suggested the notch was
    he still here (along with touch bar etc)

     They’ve actually begun fully embracing the notch.  The HIG (Human Interface Guidelines) explicitly tells
    designers/developers not to hide the notch with a black bar.

     After the camera bump. All bets are off on design decisions.

     Because it's a reserved space for the top icons. The non notch makes it annoying because some apps can
    mess with the top bar. It's definitively better this way. They should have just made a separate LCD for
    the top and made it black then people wouldn't complain.

     So maybe they thought about it a lot, and did all sorts of tests, and decided this was the best option,
    and perhaps none of us really know what it's like because we haven't actually used them.  Naw, probably
    redditors know what's happening better than them.

     there's a lot of notch already. camera protrusion, battery case...

     It used to be about aesthetic and design. Now it's about gouging money from sheep

     It's cause Tim Cook sucks as a CEO.  Go ahead, down vote me.

     They gotta make you want the x2 when they remove the bezel or make it a mbp touch bar

     THIS!   Product Design Lead: ""but it's obtrusive, people are going to hate this phone SIMPLY because of
    this""  Product Manager: ""STFU, they'll never notice it""   ...

     I’m not sure they actually care anymore

     You should see the iPhone battery case.



 I don't mind the ears if the would have made it limited to status display only,
those cut off videos are quite annoying. 
 
     You can change the video to true aspect ratio by double tapping the screen, and the notch disappears.

     The videos default to a size that doesn't include the bezel. In order to include the bezel blocking part
    of the video, you have to zoom the video via double tap.

     Just like how it already works, the phone will show the full video with black bars, but if you double tap
    it will zoom in to take up the full space.

     If they made the ears “invisible” to apps and it was just status and some touch/swipe shortcuts it would
    be perfect. Better than not being there at all. Luckily that’s something they can change in software
    later.

     They should've have reserved that space for information.

     There are internal builds doing this with at least one fork making it user selectable. Wouldn’t be
    surprised if this was revisited depending on how it’s received.



 The notch was intruding in all the games they showed on the iPhone X. That's
unacceptable. In one game a UI button was cut because of the notch! 
 
     I have a feeling this is a setting. It seems Apple wanted to emphasize how big the screens feels when
    watching movies and playing games. In hands on videos they show toggling this from fit to screen to having
    bezels. Apple was going to be critiqued either way, so they probably went with fitting to screen simply to
    show off the display.

     I'm betting this was just an unfortunate issue because the hardware is new and developers haven't had a
    chance to update things and not a sign that all apps will just get stuck ""behind"" the notch at the top.

     That'll probably be updated by devs when they see it happening. Especially with the noise people are
    making about it. And rightly so. This mockup would be better to switch to for, say, watching video. Just
    let the home screen be like that.

     I'm have a feeling it is there to allow the X2 to take it out; thus, devaluing the previous gen. even
    more.  They could have easily left the top bar with a black background to obfuscate the notch.

     You honestly believe developers won't move buttons over 20 points? Also, I imagine the devs need to
    explicitly state they support ""tall screens"", much like Android devs had to once the S8 came out.

     Probably because those games and apps need to be updated to account for the X
    https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/iphone-x/

     It was 1/15th of the button and I'm sure it will be fixed before release. Its not the end of the world.

     Woah it's almost like the phone was announced yesterday!

     That's because game designers need back the necessary updates yet.



 I would have thought smaller lips on both top and bottom with a skinny touch ID
would have been best. 
 
     Skinny Touch ID is tricky though if you want a reliable scan with one read. Otherwise you'll get the
    awkward solution Samsung came with where you had to slide your finger over the button.

     they should have put the fingerprint scanner on the back or on the power button (like sony)

     I'm excited for face ID. The user attention awareness is super cool, and Touch ID never had more than a
    60% success rate for me.

     Digital touch button

     Having bought a Nexus 6P after owning an iPhone 6 I find that fingerprint sensors on the back are much
    more comfortable to use.

     Should have been inside the apple logo on the back..

     This is what I'm saying. Or they could have put it on the back.



 Except the forehead would be bigger? https://imgur.com/a/SNtO8  Edit: corrected
scaling 
 
     Ehh?? At least make the phones the same size  https://i.imgur.com/3bBILad.png

     This needs more upvotes. Also, the mockups don't show it with a status bar.

     [deleted]

     Would they need as much vertical space if they had more horizontal space to work with though? Part of the
    reason for that extra height is they have to fit speakers, sensors, and the camera in there. If they can
    space that out horizontally it's plausible that they don't need it as tall.

     Exactly.  OP is pretending they can put pixels right on top of all the sensors...

     Two phones on the right are little bit higher/bigger ... so the forehead wouldn't be that big.

     Make the bottom the same size and add another speaker and then profit.

     Why would it need to be bigger?

     That top bezel just went from ""hmm.. ok I like"" to ""well that's way too thick""  But the notch though...
    still not sure

     still looks 100x better

     If the alternative bezel actually came to fruition, it obviously wouldn't be the same height. It would be
    the same surface area, just spread around.

     Presumably they could have spread out the cameras and sensors horizontally if they were going to take that
    approach.



 I really like the round corners of the screen. It's weird but it gives an
organic feel. 
 
     It's look pleasing with a background image, but from a design perspective it's horrible. Look at your
    current screen. The hard corner means the signal dots and time can be put right up in the corner. But with
    a rounded corner you have to move it down and to the right more and more based on how rounded the corner
    is.   This phone has the biggest rounded corners I've seen on a phone, and look at how awkwardly the time
    sits on the left and the status icons are crammed to the right. It's a big problem and going to look very
    weird.

     I dig it, too. I come from Android, and we had a custom ROM, I forget what device it was for, but it was
    all the rage a few years ago to use this root app that rounded off the corners. Probably the Galaxy S3,
    because OLED turns off pixels not in use. Anyway, it was a really cool effect that I was hoping an OEM
    would pick up on. Now, it wasn't as round as this, it was just a few pixels shaved, a real subtle effect.
    Still, I'm sure Apple (Jony Ive) spent ages pondering the perfect amount. It may cut off some video logos
    (and hopefully more than a few watermarks), but overall I like it.

Wtf???

 I think you should stop using your phone 78h every hour. It’s not good.   Jokes
aside, pretty buggy, but never saw it go nuts like this. I had it just be 24h of
absolutely nothing, just that gray line saying time spent on the homescreen. 
 


 Because screen time is incredibly buggy 
 


 Dear time traveler, you have been caught. 
 


 what is bro doing on com.apple.Quicklook 
 


 Maybe slow down a little 
 


 Because apparently Apple relies on Apple intelligence to do the calculations for
screen time 
 


 you must really like canva… and safari 
 
     I’m not on those apps tho! As soon as I click on my actual screen time app it appears disappears… I do
    have a MacBook so maybe it’s connected. Thought I have disabled sharing across devices. Maybe I should
    reboot my MacBook & my iPhone

Ok, I’m a tech-literate guy. I feel like I know a thing or two about the Apple
ecosystem.  Why, for the life of me, is setting Screen Time limits on the most
abusive apps so hard?  I literally have TikTok set to zero minutes and, while
other apps respect the settings, Chinese Teen Mindflayer app DGAF.  All app
screen limits are set to block after the limit is reached.   Any ideas?

     I do want my daughter to have access, but not 4 hours a day ;)



 Am I missing something? If you have Tik Tok set to zero minutes and want it
blocked - why do you even have the app installed? Just delete it 
 
     maybe they’re just trying to demonstrate a point. 



 iOS may not be able to calculate 0s, try something a little higher or delete the
app.

"Screen protector fails in this same spot every time, what is causing this?","Screen protector fails in this same spot every time, what is causing this?

I am losing my mind. 6 month old 16 Pro, this is the 4th time I have had a
screen protector get bubbles in this exact spot. I have used multiple different
brands at this point. I am starting to think my phone is damaged and the screen
is warped in that spot. Anyone else had this issue? Still under the 1 year
warranty, might try to open a ticket with Apple. This is maddening.

 Volume buttons flexing the chassis/screen ever so slightly it’s working loose
the adhesive over time? 
 
     This would actually make the most sense



 Check if the case is rubbing against the screen protector 
 
     It’s not, there’s a good size gap



 Had this happen on my 6s and my 12 mini in the exact spot, multiple protectors
on each one. Just got a 16, curious if same happens 
 


 This is a problem with the 16 lineup, everyone (or a large majority) seems to
have the problem, I myself, tried with the glass 2.0 from dbrand (40$screen
protector) and got this  Tried with spigen and same thing, the whole left and
left upper part of the screen just never adhere, even after 4+ screen protectors
Just look online, everyone having a 16 is losing their mind over this, never had
this problem with any other phone ever 
 
     Has anyone found a screen protector that doesn't have this issue?

     So frustrating. What case are you using?

     Meanwhile I have a mini hair after installing Spigen and I wanna h@ng myself.



 my mums 12pm does this i got her a different case and it seemed to stop 
 
     What kind of case did she have before?



 I have a 16 Pro and use a privacy screen protector and they tend to be a bit
thicker and harder. I have had no issues perhaps reconsider and buy these 
 


 Did you try applying it from that side lol? 
 
     That’s a good idea, I can’t remember which side I started with before. I had one of those easy install
    trays.



 Same with my 14 Pro, no matter what glass I get it will fail from same spot,
also same for my iPhone Xs. 
 
     So frustrating. What case are you using?



 Never an Issue with spigen 
 
     Case or screen protector? Please link the one you use



 You’re probably right-handed and actually use your phone for phone calls. That
is sweat, grease and friction from your ear that is causing this.

     I’m weirdly excited for the fonts

     Does anyone have a shareable link to the beta? Sorry, I got hooked up last year and am too excited to wait
    for PB.

     Holy shit there’s some great stuff in there. I’m from Ireland so I don’t deal with a lot of cold calls but
    you guys in the UK and the States should be very excited about sending unknown callers straight to
    voicemail.  I’m personally very excited about the CarPlay updates. Got a new car a few weeks ago and it
    has CarPlay. I love it. But it annoyed me that I couldn’t have Google Maps on my dash and Spotify on my
    phone. What’s the point in two screens if they’re going to nearly mirror each other?  Apple did well with
    this feature list, even if a lot of it is late to the game.

     Thank you for the link. WOW that's a lot of changes with iOS 13! They have redesigned Maps and CarPlay as
    well as follow-along lyrics on Apple Music. WOW. When is this dropping??

     As an android user from all, you were seriously not given the option? What constitutes a large app? I have

    one](https://i.imgur.com/fji1J5R.jpg).



 What about calls taking full screen 
 
     Hold your horses, only one revolutionary change at a time!

     This is one thing that really irks me that it’s still on iOS — it makes no sense. They added sending calls
    to voicemail if they’re unknown, but like, Wtf?? I don’t want my phone locked down waiting for a call to
    ring out, and I don’t want to purposefully ignore a call either. Unbelievable. This should’ve been fixed
    ever since call data and phone/app data could be handled separately. Sigh.  Guess we just gotta hope that
    enough people complain in the beta and MAYBE they’ll listen. But probably not.

     Please, taking calls is no longer a primary use of an iPhone - it’s likely the least I use my phone for,
    yet if someone is calling I can’t do anything else except stare at the phone and see who is calling.

     It looks like it’s still in iOS

     I want the phone to go mute when I’m on a call, it’s so annoying hearing notifications while talking to
    someone

     Asking the real questions!

     That and the low battery alert box are my two main iOS gripes, both of which seem like enormously stupid
    design decisions.

     Absolutely obnoxious. The most innovative company in the world is like 10 years behind on some features.

     Even though the latest processor is highly advanced, this is just too fancy of a feature right now

     see you in 10 more years!

     Nope still the same

     It is still there.  I’m on the dev beta.

     And that shit where if you get a call while your phone is locked you have to wait for them to hang up
    before you can get into your phone. No option to deny the call, just answer or ignore.

     Larger album art on the lock screen is probably not in the cards then, I assume.

     Just decline the damn call! You all are the worst kind of people 😂

     Hey now, don't want to be like lowly Android users now..

     Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but I wouldn't have it any other way. If I'm on the phone with someone
    I want it to take up the whole screen. If I need to see something else I can still open it. I am perfectly
    happy with the way it works and I hope they give you the option to keep things that way if a change is
    introduced.

     It’s the primary function of the device, of course it’s gonna take up the entire screen. You’re either
    gonna answer it or you’re not, that’s why there’s an option to ignore it.



 What about Siri? Are we stuck with it taking up the entire screen still? 
 
     It seem like it. Apple May have just considered this “minor” and left this off their website

     no

     I didn’t see anything about full-screen Siri for iOS but the CarPlay notes did mention reducing the size
    of Siri to allow onscreen navigation to remain visible.   All that to say, I’m hopeful!

     I’ve got the beta, and Siri is still full-screen.

     And will she stop being a fucking smart ass and drop her comedy bullshit?



 [Here’s the volume HUD in action. ](https://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/bwfxcy

     Amazing, I'll take my words back.  &#x200B;  [Instagram's one](https://i.imgur.com/P0eUkt0.jpg) is still
    better though.

     Oh shit, I love that. The chunky part is useful in case you accidentally press the volume.

     Hear me and rejoice! You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Tim Apple.

     And my device didn't support it. Still waiting for a worthy upgrade. Maybe iPhone 2020



 Bout damn time! 
 
     Honestly, I'm REALLY surprised that it took 13 versions of the software for them to fix this. It should
    have been fixed prior to the release of the first iPhone.  [Here's what it looks
    like](https://i.imgur.com/fji1J5R.jpg).   Also - since every upgrade slows down your phone... this is
    probably one of the only things that will actually get me to upgrade. This is such a big enhancement that
    it might be worth upgrading.

     What a welcome change!
